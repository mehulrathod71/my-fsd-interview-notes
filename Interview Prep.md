## Top 20 Array Questions
## Top 20 String Questions
Here are 20 commonly asked string coding questions in Java interviews, along with brief descriptions:

### Basic Questions
1. **Reverse a String**
   - Write a Java program to reverse a string without using the `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` classes.

2. **Check for Palindrome**
   - Write a Java function to check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

3. **Count Occurrences of a Character**
   - How would you count the number of occurrences of a specific character in a string in Java?

4. **Anagram Check**
   - Write a Java program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.

5. **Check for Unique Characters**
   - Write a Java program to determine if a string has all unique characters.

### Intermediate Questions
6. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
   - Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.

7. **Reverse Words in a String**
   - Write a Java program to reverse the words in a given string.

8. **String to Integer (atoi)**
   - Implement the `atoi` function to convert a string to an integer.

9. **Longest Palindromic Substring**
   - Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

10. **String Permutations**
    - Generate all permutations of a given string.

### Advanced Questions
11. **Group Anagrams**
    - Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

12. **Minimum Window Substring**
    - Find the minimum window substring in a given string that contains all characters of another string.

13. **Valid Parentheses**
    - Check if a string containing only parentheses is valid (properly closed and nested).

14. **Longest Common Prefix**
    - Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

15. **Zigzag Conversion**
    - Convert a given string to a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows.

16. **Multiply Strings**
    - Multiply two non-negative integers represented as strings.

17. **Wildcard Matching**
    - Implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `?` and `*`.

18. **Regular Expression Matching**
    - Implement regular expression matching with support for `.` and `*`.

19. **Decode Ways**
    - Count the number of ways to decode a given encoded message.

20. **Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters**
    - Find the length of the longest substring that contains at most K distinct characters.

These questions cover a wide range of string manipulation and algorithmic challenges, helping you prepare effectively for coding interviews[1](https://www.a2zjavainterviewprep.com/2023/10/top-20-string-programming-and-coding.html)[2](https://akcoding.com/java-string-interview-questions-and-answers/)[3](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/01/top-20-string-coding-interview-question-programming-interview.html).
