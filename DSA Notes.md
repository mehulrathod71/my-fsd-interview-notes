# What is Prefix sum

A **prefix sum**, also known as a cumulative sum, is a technique used to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in an array up to a certain index. It is particularly useful for range sum queries and dynamic programming problems.

### How Prefix Sum Works
The prefix sum of an array is a new array where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the original array up to index `i`.

#### Example:
Given an array `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the prefix sum array `pref` would be `[1, 3, 6, 10, 15]`. This can be calculated as follows:
- `pref[0] = a[0]`
- `pref[1] = a[0] + a[1]`
- `pref[2] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`
- `pref[3] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3]`
- `pref[4] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] + a[4]`

### Example in Java

Here's a simple example of how to calculate the prefix sum of an array in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class PrefixSumExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] originalArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] prefixSumArray = new int[originalArray.length];

        // The first element of the prefix sum array is the same as the original array
        prefixSumArray[0] = originalArray[0];

        // Calculate the prefix sum
        for (int i = 1; i < originalArray.length; i++) {
            prefixSumArray[i] = prefixSumArray[i - 1] + originalArray[i];
        }

        // Print the original and prefix sum arrays
        System.out.println("Original Array: " + Arrays.toString(originalArray));
        System.out.println("Prefix Sum Array: " + Arrays.toString(prefixSumArray));
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We initialize the `prefixSumArray` with the same length as the `originalArray`.
2. **First Element**: The first element of the `prefixSumArray` is set to the first element of the `originalArray`.
3. **Loop**: We loop through the `originalArray` starting from the second element, and for each element, we add the current element of the `originalArray` to the previous element of the `prefixSumArray`.
4. **Output**: Finally, we print both the original and the prefix sum arrays.

#### Output:
```
Original Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Prefix Sum Array: [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
```

This example demonstrates how to compute the prefix sum in Java, which can be useful for various computational problems[1](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Solve-the-prefix-sum-problem).

# How Sliding Window works and explain with example in java
The **Sliding Window** technique is an efficient way to solve problems involving subarrays or substrings within a certain window size. It reduces the need for nested loops by maintaining a window that slides over the data structure, updating the result incrementally.

### Example: Finding the Maximum Sum of a Subarray of Fixed Size

Here's how you can implement the Sliding Window technique in Java to find the maximum sum of a subarray of a fixed size `k`:

```java
public class SlidingWindow {
    public static int maxSumSubarray(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n < k) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Array length must be greater than or equal to k");
        }

        // Compute the sum of the first window
        int maxSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            maxSum += nums[i];
        }

        int windowSum = maxSum;
        for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
            windowSum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
        }

        return maxSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println("Maximum sum of subarray of size " + k + " is " + maxSumSubarray(nums, k)); // Output: 27
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `maxSumSubarray` method initializes the sum of the first window of size `k`.
2. **Sliding the Window**: The window slides from the start to the end of the array. For each new position of the window, the sum is updated by subtracting the element that is left out of the window and adding the new element that enters the window.
3. **Updating the Maximum Sum**: The maximum sum is updated at each step if the current window sum is greater than the previous maximum sum.

### Example Output

For the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and `k = 3`, the output will be:
```
Maximum sum of subarray of size 3 is 27
```

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array[1](https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/sliding-window-algorithm-in-java/)[2](https://www.javatpoint.com/sliding-window-algorithm).

# How Two Pointers works and explain with example in java

The **Two Pointers** technique is a powerful algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists. It involves using two pointers to traverse the data structure simultaneously, often starting from different ends or moving at different speeds. This technique is particularly useful for finding pairs, subarrays, or sequences that meet specific criteria.

### Example: Finding Two Numbers that Add Up to a Target

Here's how you can implement the Two Pointers technique in Java to find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target:

```java
public class TwoPointersExample {
    public static boolean twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
            if (sum == target) {
                return true;
            } else if (sum < target) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9};
        int target = 10;
        System.out.println("Two numbers add up to " + target + ": " + twoSum(nums, target)); // Output: true
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `twoSum` method initializes two pointers, `left` at the start of the array and `right` at the end.
2. **Traversing the Array**: The pointers move towards each other:
   - If the sum of the elements at the two pointers equals the target, return `true`.
   - If the sum is less than the target, increment the `left` pointer to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the `right` pointer to decrease the sum.
3. **Result**: If the pointers meet without finding a pair that adds up to the target, return `false`.

### Example Output

For the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9]` and target `10`, the output will be:
```
Two numbers add up to 10: true
```

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array[1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-two-pointer-technique)[2](https://www.javatpoint.com/two-pointers-technique).

# How Fast and Slow Pointers works and explain with example in java

The **Fast and Slow Pointers** technique, also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, is used to detect cycles in linked lists or arrays. This technique involves using two pointers that move at different speeds. The fast pointer moves two steps at a time, while the slow pointer moves one step at a time. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.

### Example: Detecting a Cycle in a Linked List

Here's how you can implement the Fast and Slow Pointers technique in Java to detect a cycle in a linked list:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;

    ListNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class LinkedListCycle {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return false;
        }

        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;

            if (slow == fast) {
                return true; // Cycle detected
            }
        }

        return false; // No cycle
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedListCycle cycleDetector = new LinkedListCycle();

        // Creating a linked list with a cycle
        ListNode head = new ListNode(3);
        head.next = new ListNode(2);
        head.next.next = new ListNode(0);
        head.next.next.next = new ListNode(-4);
        head.next.next.next.next = head.next; // Creating a cycle

        System.out.println("Cycle detected: " + cycleDetector.hasCycle(head)); // Output: true
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `hasCycle` method initializes two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the head of the linked list.
2. **Traversal**: The `while` loop continues as long as the `fast` pointer and its next node are not null. Inside the loop:
   - The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time.
   - The `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.
3. **Cycle Detection**: If the `slow` pointer meets the `fast` pointer, a cycle is detected, and the method returns `true`.
4. **No Cycle**: If the loop exits without the pointers meeting, the method returns `false`, indicating no cycle.

### Example Output

For the given linked list with nodes `[3, 2, 0, -4]` and a cycle created by connecting the last node to the second node, the output will be:
```
Cycle detected: true
```

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list[1](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/fast-slow-pointers/)[2](https://iq.opengenus.org/fast-and-slow-pointer-technique/).

# How Merge Intervals works and explain with example in java

The **Merge Intervals** problem involves combining overlapping intervals into a single interval. This is useful in various applications such as scheduling, data analysis, and computational geometry.

### Example: Merging Overlapping Intervals

Here's how you can implement the Merge Intervals algorithm in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Interval {
    int start;
    int end;

    Interval(int start, int end) {
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }
}

public class MergeIntervals {
    public List<Interval> merge(List<Interval> intervals) {
        if (intervals == null || intervals.size() == 0) {
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }

        // Sort intervals based on the start time
        intervals.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(i -> i.start));

        List<Interval> merged = new ArrayList<>();
        Interval current = intervals.get(0);

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            Interval next = intervals.get(i);

            if (current.end >= next.start) {
                // Overlapping intervals, merge them
                current.end = Math.max(current.end, next.end);
            } else {
                // Non-overlapping interval, add the current interval to the list
                merged.add(current);
                current = next;
            }
        }

        // Add the last interval
        merged.add(current);

        return merged;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MergeIntervals merger = new MergeIntervals();
        List<Interval> intervals = Arrays.asList(
            new Interval(1, 3),
            new Interval(2, 6),
            new Interval(8, 10),
            new Interval(15, 18)
        );

        List<Interval> result = merger.merge(intervals);
        System.out.println("Merged intervals:");
        for (Interval interval : result) {
            System.out.println("[" + interval.start + ", " + interval.end + "]");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `merge` method initializes by sorting the intervals based on their start times. This ensures that overlapping intervals are adjacent in the sorted list.
2. **Merging Process**: The algorithm iterates through the sorted intervals:
   - If the current interval overlaps with the next interval (i.e., the end of the current interval is greater than or equal to the start of the next interval), they are merged by updating the end of the current interval to the maximum end of both intervals.
   - If the current interval does not overlap with the next interval, the current interval is added to the merged list, and the next interval becomes the current interval.
3. **Final Step**: After the loop, the last interval is added to the merged list.

### Example Output

For the input intervals `[(1, 3), (2, 6), (8, 10), (15, 18)]`, the output will be:
```
Merged intervals:
[1, 6]
[8, 10]
[15, 18]
```

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step, where \(n\) is the number of intervals[1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-collection-merge-overlapping-intervals)[2](https://www.javatpoint.com/merge-overlapping-intervals).

# How Cyclic Sort works and explain with example in java

**Cyclic Sort** is a comparison sorting algorithm that is theoretically optimal in terms of the number of writes to the original array. It works by placing each element at its correct position in the array. This algorithm is particularly useful when dealing with arrays containing elements in a given range, such as 1 to \( n \).

### How Cyclic Sort Works

1. **Cycle Detection**: For each element, determine its correct position by counting the number of elements smaller than it.
2. **Placement**: If the element is not already at its correct position, place it there. This may displace another element, which needs to be placed in its correct position.
3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until all elements are placed at their correct positions.

### Example in Java

Here's how you can implement Cyclic Sort in Java:

```java
public class CyclicSort {
    public static void cyclicSort(int[] nums) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < nums.length) {
            int correctIndex = nums[i] - 1;
            if (nums[i] != nums[correctIndex]) {
                swap(nums, i, correctIndex);
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }

    private static void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {3, 1, 5, 4, 2};
        cyclicSort(nums);
        System.out.println("Sorted array: " + Arrays.toString(nums)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `cyclicSort` method initializes a pointer `i` to traverse the array.
2. **Correct Position Check**: For each element, calculate its correct position (`correctIndex`). If the element is not at its correct position, swap it with the element at its correct position.
3. **Swap and Continue**: If the element is already at its correct position, move to the next element. The `swap` method is used to exchange elements in the array.
4. **Result**: The array is sorted in-place with minimal writes.

### Example Output

For the input array `[3, 1, 5, 4, 2]`, the output will be:
```
Sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and a space complexity of \(O(1)\), making it optimal for sorting arrays with elements in a given range[1](https://www.javatpoint.com/cycle-sort)[2](https://algodaily.com/lessons/cycling-through-cycle-sort).

# How In-place Reversal of a Linked List works and explain with example in java

In-place reversal of a linked list involves reversing the direction of the pointers in the list so that the last node becomes the first node, the second-to-last node becomes the second node, and so on. This can be done iteratively or recursively. Here, I'll explain the iterative approach.

### Iterative Approach

The iterative approach uses three pointers to reverse the linked list: `previous`, `current`, and `next`.

1. **Initialization**: Set `previous` to `null`, `current` to the head of the list, and `next` to `null`.
2. **Traversal and Reversal**: Iterate through the list, reversing the pointers as you go:
   - Save the next node (`next = current.next`).
   - Reverse the current node's pointer (`current.next = previous`).
   - Move the `previous` and `current` pointers one step forward (`previous = current`, `current = next`).
3. **Completion**: When `current` becomes `null`, the list is fully reversed, and `previous` will be the new head of the list.

### Example in Java

Here's how you can implement the in-place reversal of a linked list in Java:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;

    ListNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class ReverseLinkedList {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode previous = null;
        ListNode current = head;
        ListNode next = null;

        while (current != null) {
            next = current.next; // Save the next node
            current.next = previous; // Reverse the current node's pointer
            previous = current; // Move previous to current
            current = next; // Move current to next
        }

        return previous; // New head of the reversed list
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReverseLinkedList list = new ReverseLinkedList();

        // Creating a linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
        ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
        head.next = new ListNode(2);
        head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
        head.next.next.next = new ListNode(4);
        head.next.next.next.next = new ListNode(5);

        System.out.println("Original list:");
        printList(head);

        // Reversing the linked list
        ListNode reversedHead = list.reverseList(head);

        System.out.println("Reversed list:");
        printList(reversedHead);
    }

    public static void printList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.print(current.val + " ");
            current = current.next;
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `reverseList` method initializes three pointers: `previous`, `current`, and `next`.
2. **Reversal Process**: The `while` loop iterates through the list, reversing the pointers:
   - `next` saves the next node.
   - `current.next` is set to `previous` to reverse the pointer.
   - `previous` and `current` are moved one step forward.
3. **Result**: The method returns `previous`, which is the new head of the reversed list.

### Example Output

For the input linked list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, the output will be:
```
Original list:
1 2 3 4 5 
Reversed list:
5 4 3 2 1 
```

This approach ensures that the linked list is reversed in-place with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and a space complexity of \(O(1)\) since no additional space is used[1](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-reverse-linked-list-in-java)[2](https://www.baeldung.com/java-reverse-linked-list).

# How Tree Depth-First Search (DFS) works and explain with example in java

Tree Depth-First Search (DFS) is a traversal algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a tree data structure. DFS starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. There are three common orders for DFS traversal in trees:

1. **Preorder Traversal**: Visit the root node first, then recursively visit the left subtree, followed by the right subtree.
2. **Inorder Traversal**: Recursively visit the left subtree first, then visit the root node, and finally the right subtree.
3. **Postorder Traversal**: Recursively visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.

Here's an example of how to implement these traversals in Java:

### Preorder Traversal
```java
class Node {
    int value;
    Node left, right;

    Node(int item) {
        value = item;
        left = right = null;
    }
}

public class BinaryTree {
    Node root;

    void traversePreOrder(Node node) {
        if (node != null) {
            System.out.print(node.value + " ");
            traversePreOrder(node.left);
            traversePreOrder(node.right);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BinaryTree tree = new BinaryTree();
        tree.root = new Node(1);
        tree.root.left = new Node(2);
        tree.root.right = new Node(3);
        tree.root.left.left = new Node(4);
        tree.root.left.right = new Node(5);

        System.out.println("Preorder traversal of binary tree is ");
        tree.traversePreOrder(tree.root);
    }
}
```

### Inorder Traversal
```java
void traverseInOrder(Node node) {
    if (node != null) {
        traverseInOrder(node.left);
        System.out.print(node.value + " ");
        traverseInOrder(node.right);
    }
}
```

### Postorder Traversal
```java
void traversePostOrder(Node node) {
    if (node != null) {
        traversePostOrder(node.left);
        traversePostOrder(node.right);
        System.out.print(node.value + " ");
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `BinaryTree` class defines a simple binary tree structure and methods for each type of DFS traversal. The `main` method demonstrates how to create a binary tree and perform a preorder traversal on it.

# How Tree Breadth-First Search (BFS) works and explain with example in java

**Tree Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is a traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level, starting from the root node and moving to the next level of nodes. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored next. BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted tree or graph.

### How BFS Works

1. **Initialization**: Start by enqueuing the root node and marking it as visited.
2. **Traversal**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, process it, and enqueue all its unvisited children.
3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the queue is empty.

### Example in Java

Here's how you can implement BFS for a binary tree in Java:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left, right;

    TreeNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = this.right = null;
    }
}

public class BinaryTreeBFS {
    TreeNode root;

    void bfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(node);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode current = queue.poll();
            System.out.print(current.val + " ");

            if (current.left != null) {
                queue.add(current.left);
            }

            if (current.right != null) {
                queue.add(current.right);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BinaryTreeBFS tree = new BinaryTreeBFS();
        tree.root = new TreeNode(1);
        tree.root.left = new TreeNode(2);
        tree.root.right = new TreeNode(3);
        tree.root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
        tree.root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);

        System.out.println("Breadth-First Search traversal of binary tree is:");
        tree.bfs(tree.root);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `bfs` method initializes a queue and enqueues the root node.
2. **Traversal**: The `while` loop continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration:
   - Dequeue the front node and process it (print its value).
   - Enqueue the left and right children of the current node if they exist.
3. **Result**: The nodes are processed level by level, starting from the root.

### Example Output

For the given binary tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```
The output will be:
```
Breadth-First Search traversal of binary tree is:
1 2 3 4 5
```

This approach ensures that all nodes are visited level by level, making it suitable for finding the shortest path in unweighted trees or graphs[1](https://www.guru99.com/breadth-first-search-bfs-graph-example.html)[2](https://www.javatpoint.com/bfs-algorithm-in-java).

# How Binary Search works and explain with example in java

**Binary Search** is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and comparing the target value with the middle element. If the target value is equal to the middle element, the search is successful. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half; otherwise, it continues in the right half.

### How Binary Search Works

1. **Initialization**: Start with two pointers, `low` (beginning of the array) and `high` (end of the array).
2. **Middle Element**: Calculate the middle element using `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.
3. **Comparison**:
   - If the target value matches the middle element, return its index.
   - If the target value is smaller than the middle element, search the left half (`high = mid - 1`).
   - If the target value is larger than the middle element, search the right half (`low = mid + 1`).
4. **Repeat**: Continue this process until `low` exceeds `high` or the target value is found.
5. **Result**: If the target value is not found, return `-1`.

### Example in Java

Here's a simple implementation of Binary Search in Java:

```java
public class BinarySearch {
    public static int binarySearch(int[] array, int key) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = array.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // Calculate mid to prevent overflow
            if (array[mid] == key) {
                return mid; // Key found, return index
            } else if (array[mid] < key) {
                low = mid + 1; // Search in the right half
            } else {
                high = mid - 1; // Search in the left half
            }
        }

        return -1; // Key not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        int key = 30;
        int result = binarySearch(numbers, key);
        if (result != -1) {
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + result);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element not found.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `binarySearch` method initializes `low` and `high` pointers to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. **Middle Element Calculation**: The middle index `mid` is calculated to avoid overflow.
3. **Comparison and Search**: The target value is compared with the middle element:
   - If equal, the index is returned.
   - If the target is greater, the search continues in the right half.
   - If the target is less, the search continues in the left half.
4. **Result**: If the loop ends without finding the target, `-1` is returned.

### Example Output

For the input array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and target `30`, the output will be:
```
Element found at index: 2
```

This approach ensures that the search is efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array[1](https://javacodepoint.com/logical-programs/binary-search-in-java-examples/)[2](https://www.javatpoint.com/binary-search-in-java).

# How Dynamic Programming works and explain with example in java

**Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem just once, and storing their solutions. This approach avoids redundant calculations and optimizes the overall solution. DP is particularly useful for optimization problems where you need to find the minimum or maximum solution.

### Key Concepts of Dynamic Programming

1. **Optimal Substructure**: A problem has an optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
2. **Overlapping Subproblems**: A problem has overlapping subproblems if the same subproblems are solved multiple times.

### Example: Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of a problem that can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming. The sequence is defined as:
$$
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
$$
with base cases \( F(0) = 0 \) and \( F(1) = 1 \).

#### Recursive Approach (Inefficient)

```java
public class FibonacciRecursive {
    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        }
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // Example: Find the 10th Fibonacci number
        System.out.println("Fibonacci number at position " + n + " is " + fibonacci(n));
    }
}
```

This approach is inefficient because it recalculates the same subproblems multiple times, leading to an exponential time complexity.

#### Dynamic Programming Approach (Efficient)

```java
public class FibonacciDP {
    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        }

        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }

        return dp[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // Example: Find the 10th Fibonacci number
        System.out.println("Fibonacci number at position " + n + " is " + fibonacci(n));
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `fibonacci` method initializes an array `dp` to store the Fibonacci numbers up to `n`.
2. **Base Cases**: The base cases \( F(0) = 0 \) and \( F(1) = 1 \) are set.
3. **Filling the DP Table**: The loop fills the `dp` array by summing the previous two values for each position.
4. **Result**: The method returns `dp[n]`, which contains the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number.

### Example Output

For \( n = 10 \), the output will be:
```
Fibonacci number at position 10 is 55
```

This approach ensures that each subproblem is solved only once, resulting in a time complexity of \( O(n) \) and a space complexity of \( O(n) \) due to the array used for storing intermediate results[1](https://www.javatpoint.com/dynamic-programming)[2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-dynamic-programming-in-java/).

# How Greedy Algorithms works and explain with example in java

**Greedy Algorithms** are a class of algorithms that make a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment, with the hope of finding a global optimum. The key idea is to make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope that these local solutions will lead to a global solution.

### Key Concepts of Greedy Algorithms

1. **Greedy Choice Property**: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting the local optimums.
2. **Optimal Substructure**: An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems.

### Example: Coin Change Problem

The Coin Change problem is a classic example of a greedy algorithm. The goal is to make change for a given amount using the fewest number of coins from a given set of denominations.

#### Problem Statement

Given a set of coin denominations and a total amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make the total amount.

### Example in Java

Here's how you can implement the Coin Change problem using a greedy algorithm in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class CoinChange {
    public static int minCoins(int[] coins, int amount) {
        Arrays.sort(coins); // Sort the coin denominations in ascending order
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = coins.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (amount >= coins[i]) {
                amount -= coins[i];
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] coins = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100};
        int amount = 93;
        System.out.println("Minimum coins needed: " + minCoins(coins, amount)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `minCoins` method initializes by sorting the coin denominations in ascending order.
2. **Greedy Choice**: The algorithm iterates through the sorted coin denominations starting from the largest. For each coin, it subtracts the coin's value from the amount as many times as possible and increments the coin count.
3. **Result**: The method returns the total count of coins used to make the amount.

### Example Output

For the input coin denominations `[1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]` and amount `93`, the output will be:
```
Minimum coins needed: 5
```
The coins used will be `[50, 20, 20, 2, 1]`.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step, where \(n\) is the number of coin denominations[1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-greedy-algorithms)[2](https://www.javatpoint.com/greedy-algorithms).

# How Backtracking works and explain with example in java

**Backtracking** is an algorithmic technique used to solve problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point. It is particularly useful for solving problems with multiple solutions, such as puzzles, permutations, and combinations.

### Key Concepts of Backtracking

1. **Decision Problem**: Search for a feasible solution.
2. **Optimization Problem**: Search for the best solution.
3. **Enumeration Problem**: Find all feasible solutions.

### How Backtracking Works

1. **Incremental Construction**: Start with an empty solution and add elements to it incrementally.
2. **Constraint Checking**: At each step, check if the current solution satisfies the problem's constraints.
3. **Backtrack**: If the current solution does not satisfy the constraints, remove the last added element and try another possibility.
4. **Repeat**: Continue this process until all possible solutions are explored.

### Example: N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens problem is a classic example of backtracking. The goal is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

#### Java Implementation

Here's how you can implement the N-Queens problem using backtracking in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class NQueens {
    public List<List<String>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        List<List<String>> solutions = new ArrayList<>();
        char[][] board = new char[n][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                board[i][j] = '.';
            }
        }
        backtrack(solutions, board, 0);
        return solutions;
    }

    private void backtrack(List<List<String>> solutions, char[][] board, int row) {
        if (row == board.length) {
            solutions.add(construct(board));
            return;
        }

        for (int col = 0; col < board.length; col++) {
            if (isValid(board, row, col)) {
                board[row][col] = 'Q';
                backtrack(solutions, board, row + 1);
                board[row][col] = '.'; // Backtrack
            }
        }
    }

    private boolean isValid(char[][] board, int row, int col) {
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            if (board[i][col] == 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        for (int i = row - 1, j = col - 1; i >= 0 && j >= 0; i--, j--) {
            if (board[i][j] == 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        for (int i = row - 1, j = col + 1; i >= 0 && j < board.length; i--, j++) {
            if (board[i][j] == 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private List<String> construct(char[][] board) {
        List<String> path = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            path.add(new String(board[i]));
        }
        return path;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NQueens nQueens = new NQueens();
        List<List<String>> solutions = nQueens.solveNQueens(4);
        for (List<String> solution : solutions) {
            for (String row : solution) {
                System.out.println(row);
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `solveNQueens` method initializes the board and calls the `backtrack` method.
2. **Backtracking**: The `backtrack` method tries to place a queen in each column of the current row. If a valid position is found, it places the queen and recursively tries to place queens in the next row. If no valid position is found, it backtracks by removing the queen and trying the next column.
3. **Constraint Checking**: The `isValid` method checks if placing a queen at the given position is valid by ensuring no other queens are in the same column, or on the same diagonal.
4. **Constructing Solutions**: The `construct` method converts the board configuration into a list of strings representing the solution.

### Example Output

For \( n = 4 \), the output will be:
```
..Q.
Q...
...Q
.Q..

.Q..
...Q
Q...
..Q.
```

# How Graph Depth-First Search (DFS) works and explain with example in java

**Graph Depth-First Search (DFS)** is a traversal algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. It starts at a given node (often called the root) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS can be implemented using either recursion or an explicit stack.

### How DFS Works

1. **Initialization**: Start with a stack (or use recursion) and push the starting node onto the stack.
2. **Traversal**: Pop a node from the stack, mark it as visited, and push all its unvisited adjacent nodes onto the stack.
3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the stack is empty.

### Example in Java

Here's how you can implement DFS for a graph in Java using an iterative approach with a stack:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Graph {
    private int vertices; // Number of vertices
    private LinkedList<Integer>[] adjacencyList; // Adjacency list

    // Constructor
    Graph(int vertices) {
        this.vertices = vertices;
        adjacencyList = new LinkedList[vertices];
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            adjacencyList[i] = new LinkedList<>();
        }
    }

    // Add an edge to the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adjacencyList[v].add(w);
    }

    // DFS traversal from a given source
    void DFS(int start) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        stack.push(start);

        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            int node = stack.pop();

            if (!visited[node]) {
                System.out.print(node + " ");
                visited[node] = true;
            }

            for (int neighbor : adjacencyList[node]) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    stack.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Graph graph = new Graph(5);

        graph.addEdge(0, 1);
        graph.addEdge(0, 2);
        graph.addEdge(1, 2);
        graph.addEdge(2, 0);
        graph.addEdge(2, 3);
        graph.addEdge(3, 3);
        graph.addEdge(3, 4);

        System.out.println("Depth-First Search starting from node 2:");
        graph.DFS(2);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Representation**: The `Graph` class uses an adjacency list to represent the graph. The constructor initializes the adjacency list for each vertex.
2. **Adding Edges**: The `addEdge` method adds an edge from vertex `v` to vertex `w`.
3. **DFS Traversal**: The `DFS` method performs the DFS traversal:
   - Initialize a `visited` array to keep track of visited nodes.
   - Use a stack to manage the nodes to be explored.
   - Pop a node from the stack, mark it as visited, and push its unvisited neighbors onto the stack.
4. **Main Method**: The `main` method creates a graph, adds edges, and starts the DFS traversal from node 2.

### Example Output

For the given graph:
```
0 -> 1, 2
1 -> 2
2 -> 0, 3
3 -> 3, 4
4 -> 
```
The output will be:
```
Depth-First Search starting from node 2:
2 3 4 0 1
```

This approach ensures that all nodes reachable from the starting node are visited, making it suitable for exploring connected components in a graph[1](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph-dfs)[2](https://www.javatpoint.com/depth-first-search-algorithm).

# How Graph Breadth-First Search (BFS) works and explain with example in java

**Graph Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is a traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level, starting from the root node and moving to the next level of nodes. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored next. BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### How BFS Works

1. **Initialization**: Start by enqueuing the root node and marking it as visited.
2. **Traversal**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, process it, and enqueue all its unvisited adjacent nodes.
3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the queue is empty.

### Example in Java

Here's how you can implement BFS for a graph in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Graph {
    private int vertices; // Number of vertices
    private LinkedList<Integer>[] adjacencyList; // Adjacency list

    // Constructor
    Graph(int vertices) {
        this.vertices = vertices;
        adjacencyList = new LinkedList[vertices];
        for (int i = 0; i++) {
            adjacencyList[i] = new LinkedList<>();
        }
    }

    // Add an edge to the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adjacencyList[v].add(w);
    }

    // BFS traversal from a given source
    void BFS(int start) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices];
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        visited[start] = true;
        queue.add(start);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int node = queue.poll();
            System.out.print(node + " ");

            for (int neighbor : adjacencyList[node]) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    queue.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Graph graph = new Graph(5);

        graph.addEdge(0, 1);
        graph.addEdge(0, 2);
        graph.addEdge(1, 2);
        graph.addEdge(2, 0);
        graph.addEdge(2, 3);
        graph.addEdge(3, 3);
        graph.addEdge(3, 4);

        System.out.println("Breadth-First Search starting from node 2:");
        graph.BFS(2);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Representation**: The `Graph` class uses an adjacency list to represent the graph. The constructor initializes the adjacency list for each vertex.
2. **Adding Edges**: The `addEdge` method adds an edge from vertex `v` to vertex `w`.
3. **BFS Traversal**: The `BFS` method performs the BFS traversal:
   - Initialize a `visited` array to keep track of visited nodes.
   - Use a queue to manage the nodes to be explored.

3 -> 3, 4
4 ->

2 0 3 1 4

# How Topological sort works and explain with example in java

**Topological Sort** is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge \( u \rightarrow v \), vertex \( u \) comes before vertex \( v \) in the ordering. This is particularly useful in scenarios like task scheduling, where certain tasks must be completed before others.

### How Topological Sort Works

1. **Initialization**: Start with a graph represented using an adjacency list.
2. **Indegree Calculation**: Calculate the indegree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex.
3. **Queue Initialization**: Initialize a queue and enqueue all vertices with an indegree of 0.
4. **Processing Vertices**: Dequeue a vertex from the queue, add it to the topological order, and decrease the indegree of its adjacent vertices. If an adjacent vertex's indegree becomes 0, enqueue it.
5. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the queue is empty.

### Example in Java

Here's how you can implement Topological Sort using Kahn's algorithm in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Graph {
    private int vertices; // Number of vertices
    private LinkedList<Integer>[] adjacencyList; // Adjacency list

    // Constructor
    Graph(int vertices) {
        this.vertices = vertices;
        adjacencyList = new LinkedList[vertices];
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            adjacencyList[i] = new LinkedList<>();
        }
    }

    // Add an edge to the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adjacencyList[v].add(w);
    }

    // Topological Sort using Kahn's Algorithm
    void topologicalSort() {
        int[] indegree = new int[vertices];
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            for (int neighbor : adjacencyList[i]) {
                indegree[neighbor]++;
            }
        }

        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                queue.add(i);
            }
        }

        int count = 0;
        List<Integer> topOrder = new ArrayList<>();
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int node = queue.poll();
            topOrder.add(node);

            for (int neighbor : adjacencyList[node]) {
                if (--indegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                    queue.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
            count++;
        }

        if (count != vertices) {
            System.out.println("There exists a cycle in the graph");
            return;
        }

        System.out.println("Topological Sort:");
        for (int node : topOrder) {
            System.out.print(node + " ");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Graph graph = new Graph(6);
        graph.addEdge(5, 2);
        graph.addEdge(5, 0);
        graph.addEdge(4, 0);
        graph.addEdge(4, 1);
        graph.addEdge(2, 3);
        graph.addEdge(3, 1);

        System.out.println("Topological Sort of the given graph:");
        graph.topologicalSort();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Representation**: The `Graph` class uses an adjacency list to represent the graph. The constructor initializes the adjacency list for each vertex.
2. **Adding Edges**: The `addEdge` method adds a directed edge from vertex `v` to vertex `w`.
3. **Topological Sort**: The `topologicalSort` method performs the topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm:
   - Calculate the indegree of each vertex.
   - Initialize a queue with all vertices having an indegree of 0.
   - Process each vertex by adding it to the topological order and reducing the indegree of its neighbors. Enqueue neighbors with an indegree of 0.
   - Check for cycles by ensuring the count of processed vertices equals the number of vertices.
4. **Main Method**: The `main` method creates a graph, adds edges, and performs the topological sort.

### Example Output

For the given graph:
```
5 -> 2
5 -> 0
4 -> 0
4 -> 1
2 -> 3
3 -> 1
```
The output will be:
```
Topological Sort of the given graph:
5 4 2 3 1 0
```

This approach ensures that the vertices are printed in a topologically sorted order, respecting the dependencies represented by the directed edges[1](https://www.javatpoint.com/topological-sorting)[2](https://www.javatpoint.com/kahns-algorithm-for-topological-sorting-in-java)[3](https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/topological-sort-java-example/).

# How Scheduling Pattern works and explain with example in java for coding question

The **Scheduling Pattern** is a design pattern used to manage the execution of tasks or jobs at specific intervals or based on certain conditions. This pattern is particularly useful for automating repetitive tasks, handling background processes, and ensuring timely execution of critical operations.

### Key Components of a Job Scheduler

1. **Job**: The unit of work or task that needs to be executed. This can be a simple Java class with an `execute()` method.
2. **Trigger**: Defines when a job should be executed. Triggers can be time-based (e.g., run every hour) or event-based (e.g., trigger when a specific condition is met).
3. **Scheduler**: The core component responsible for managing and executing jobs based on their triggers.

### Example: Simple Job Scheduler in Java

Here's how you can implement a simple job scheduler in Java:

#### Job Interface
```java
interface Job {
    void execute();
}
```

#### Example Job
```java
class ExampleJob implements Job {
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Executing ExampleJob at " + System.currentTimeMillis());
    }
}
```

#### Trigger Interface
```java
interface Trigger {
    boolean shouldRun();
}
```

#### Time-Based Trigger
```java
class TimeBasedTrigger implements Trigger {
    private long interval;
    private long lastRunTime;

    public TimeBasedTrigger(long interval) {
        this.interval = interval;
        this.lastRunTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean shouldRun() {
        long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        if (currentTime - lastRunTime >= interval) {
            lastRunTime = currentTime;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### Scheduler
```java
class Scheduler {
    private List<Job> jobs = new ArrayList<>();
    private List<Trigger> triggers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addJob(Job job, Trigger trigger) {
        jobs.add(job);
        triggers.add(trigger);
    }

    public void start() {
        while (true) {
            for (int i = 0; i < jobs.size(); i++) {
                if (triggers.get(i).shouldRun()) {
                    jobs.get(i).execute();
                }
            }
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Check triggers every second
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Main Method
```java
public class JobSchedulerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scheduler scheduler = new Scheduler();
        Job exampleJob = new ExampleJob();
        Trigger timeBasedTrigger = new TimeBasedTrigger(5000); // Run every 5 seconds

        scheduler.addJob(exampleJob, timeBasedTrigger);
        scheduler.start();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Job Interface**: Defines a simple interface with an `execute()` method that any job class must implement.
2. **Example Job**: Implements the `Job` interface and defines the task to be executed.
3. **Trigger Interface**: Defines an interface with a `shouldRun()` method to determine when a job should run.
4. **Time-Based Trigger**: Implements the `Trigger` interface and checks if the specified interval has passed since the last run.
5. **Scheduler**: Manages jobs and their triggers. It continuously checks the triggers and executes the corresponding jobs when their triggers indicate they should run.
6. **Main Method**: Creates a scheduler, adds a job with a time-based trigger, and starts the scheduler.

### Example Output

The output will be:
```
Executing ExampleJob at 1643236504884
Executing ExampleJob at 1643236510001
Executing ExampleJob at 1643236515001
Executing ExampleJob at 1643236520001
```

This approach ensures that jobs are executed at specified intervals, making it suitable for automating repetitive tasks[1](https://www.javatpoint.com/design-a-job-scheduler-in-java)[2](https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/java-scheduling-example/).

# How array works internally in Java

In Java, arrays are a fundamental data structure that store elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Here's a deeper look at how arrays work internally:

1. **Memory Allocation**: When you declare an array, memory is allocated based on the specified size and data type. This memory allocation happens in the heap, which is the region of memory reserved for dynamic memory allocation in Java[1](https://dev.to/_bhupeshk_/arrays-and-arraylist-in-java-1jc2).

2. **Contiguous Storage**: Array elements are stored consecutively in memory, ensuring efficient access. This means that elements can be accessed directly using their indices[1](https://dev.to/_bhupeshk_/arrays-and-arraylist-in-java-1jc2).

3. **Indexing**: Each element in the array is assigned an index starting from 0. When you access an element using its index, the Java runtime calculates the memory address of the element based on its index and the size of the data type[1](https://dev.to/_bhupeshk_/arrays-and-arraylist-in-java-1jc2).

4. **Element Access**: Accessing elements by index is very efficient, typically taking constant time, O(1). The runtime retrieves the value stored at the calculated memory address and returns it to the program[1](https://dev.to/_bhupeshk_/arrays-and-arraylist-in-java-1jc2).

5. **Fixed Size**: Arrays in Java have a fixed size, meaning their size cannot be changed after they are created. If you need to store more elements than the array allows, you would need to create a new array with a larger size and copy the elements from the old array to the new one[1](https://dev.to/_bhupeshk_/arrays-and-arraylist-in-java-1jc2).

6. **Primitive vs. Reference Types**: Arrays can hold elements of primitive data types (such as `int`, `float`, `char`) or reference types (such as objects). When an array holds elements of reference types, it actually holds references (memory addresses) to the objects rather than the objects themselves[1](https://dev.to/_bhupeshk_/arrays-and-arraylist-in-java-1jc2).

# How linked list internally works in Java

In Java, the `LinkedList` class is part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the `List` and `Deque` interfaces using a doubly linked list. Here's a detailed look at how it works internally:

### Structure
The `LinkedList` class uses a private static inner class called `Node` to represent each element in the list. Each `Node` contains three fields:
- `item`: The value of the node.
- `next`: A reference to the next node in the list.
- `prev`: A reference to the previous node in the list.

Here's a simplified version of the `Node` class:

```java
private static class Node<E> {
    E item;
    Node<E> next;
    Node<E> prev;

    Node(Node<E> prev, E element, Node<E> next) {
        this.item = element;
        this.next = next;
        this.prev = prev;
    }
}
```

### Key Operations
1. **Adding Elements**:
   - **At the Beginning**: The `linkFirst` method adds a new node at the beginning of the list.
   ```java
   private void linkFirst(E e) {
       final Node<E> f = first;
       final Node<E> newNode = new Node<>(null, e, f);
       first = newNode;
       if (f == null)
           last = newNode;
       else
           f.prev = newNode;
       size++;
       modCount++;
   }
   ```
   - **At the End**: The `linkLast` method adds a new node at the end of the list.
   ```java
   void linkLast(E e) {
       final Node<E> l = last;
       final Node<E> newNode = new Node<>(l, e, null);
       last = newNode;
       if (l == null)
           first = newNode;
       else
           l.next = newNode;
       size++;
       modCount++;
   }
   ```

2. **Removing Elements**:
   - **From the Beginning**: The `unlinkFirst` method removes the first node.
   ```java
   private E unlinkFirst(Node<E> f) {
       final E element = f.item;
       final Node<E> next = f.next;
       f.item = null;
       f.next = null; // help GC
       first = next;
       if (next == null)
           last = null;
       else
           next.prev = null;
       size--;
       modCount++;
       return element;
   }
   ```
   - **From the End**: The `unlinkLast` method removes the last node.
   ```java
   private E unlinkLast(Node<E> l) {
       final E element = l.item;
       final Node<E> prev = l.prev;
       l.item = null;
       l.prev = null; // help GC
       last = prev;
       if (prev == null)
           first = null;
       else
           prev.next = null;
       size--;
       modCount++;
       return element;
   }
   ```

### Advantages
- **Dynamic Size**: Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Adding or removing elements at the beginning or end of the list is efficient (O(1)).

### Disadvantages
- **Memory Overhead**: Each node requires extra memory for storing references to the next and previous nodes.
- **Sequential Access**: Accessing elements by index requires traversing the list from the beginning or end, making it less efficient (O(n)) compared to arrays.

Would you like to explore any specific operations or concepts related to linked lists in Java?

The `LinkedList` class in Java provides a variety of methods to manipulate and interact with the list. Here are some of the key methods:

# How Vector works internally in Java

In Java, the `Vector` class is part of the Java Collections Framework and implements a growable array of objects. It is synchronized, making it thread-safe, but this can also lead to performance overhead in multi-threaded environments. Here's a detailed look at how it works internally:

### Internal Working
1. **Dynamic Array**: The `Vector` class is essentially a dynamic array that can grow or shrink as needed. It maintains an array internally to store the elements. When the array becomes full, a new, larger array is created, and the elements are copied over.

2. **Capacity and Capacity Increment**: The `Vector` class keeps track of its capacity (the size of the internal array) and the capacity increment (the amount by which the capacity increases when the array becomes full). If the capacity increment is not specified, the capacity is doubled each time the array needs to grow.
   ```java
   newLength = capacityIncrement == 0 ? currentSize * 2 : currentSize + capacityIncrement;
   ```

3. **Synchronized Methods**: All methods in the `Vector` class are synchronized, which means they are thread-safe. This ensures that only one thread can access a method at a time, preventing concurrent modification issues.

4. **Fail-Fast Iterators**: The iterators provided by the `Vector` class are fail-fast. This means that if the vector is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, the iterator will throw a `ConcurrentModificationException`.

### Key Methods
1. **add(E e)**: Adds the specified element to the end of the vector.
   ```java
   public synchronized boolean add(E e) {
       modCount++;
       ensureCapacityHelper(elementCount + 1);
       elementData[elementCount++] = e;
       return true;
   }
   ```

2. **remove(Object o)**: Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the vector.
   ```java
   public synchronized boolean remove(Object o) {
       modCount++;
       if (o == null) {
           for (int index = 0; index < elementCount; index++)
               if (elementData[index] == null) {
                   fastRemove(index);
                   return true;
               }
       } else {
           for (int index = 0; index < elementCount; index++)
               if (o.equals(elementData[index])) {
                   fastRemove(index);
                   return true;
               }
       }
       return false;
   }
   ```

3. **get(int index)**: Returns the element at the specified position in the vector.
   ```java
   public synchronized E get(int index) {
       if (index >= elementCount)
           throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException(index);
       return elementData(index);
   }
   ```

4. **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the vector.
   ```java
   public synchronized int size() {
       return elementCount;
   }
   ```

5. **ensureCapacity(int minCapacity)**: Increases the capacity of the vector, if necessary, to ensure that it can hold at least the number of elements specified by the minimum capacity argument.
   ```java
   public synchronized void ensureCapacity(int minCapacity) {
       if (minCapacity > 0) {
           modCount++;
           ensureCapacityHelper(minCapacity);
       }
   }
   ```

### Example Usage
Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use the `Vector` class in Java:

```java
import java.util.Vector;

public class VectorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vector<Integer> vector = new Vector<>();

        // Add elements to the vector
        vector.add(10);
        vector.add(20);
        vector.add(30);

        // Get element at index 1
        System.out.println("Element at index 1: " + vector.get(1));

        // Remove element at index 2
        vector.remove(2);

        // Get the size of the vector
        System.out.println("Size of vector: " + vector.size());
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Thread-Safe**: The `Vector` class is synchronized, making it thread-safe.
- **Dynamic Size**: It can grow or shrink dynamically as needed.

### Disadvantages
- **Performance Overhead**: Synchronization can lead to performance overhead in multi-threaded environments.
- **Legacy Class**: The `Vector` class is considered a legacy class. For non-thread-safe implementations, `ArrayList` is preferred.

# How Stack works internally in Java

In Java, the `Stack` class is part of the Java Collections Framework and extends the `Vector` class. It represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. Here's a detailed look at how it works internally and the methods it provides:

### Internal Working
The `Stack` class in Java is essentially a subclass of `Vector`, which means it inherits all the properties and methods of the `Vector` class. However, it adds several methods that allow it to function as a stack. The key operations of a stack are `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `search`.

### Key Methods
1. **push(E item)**: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
   ```java
   public E push(E item) {
       addElement(item);
       return item;
   }
   ```

2. **pop()**: Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.
   ```java
   public synchronized E pop() {
       E obj;
       int len = size();
       obj = peek();
       removeElementAt(len - 1);
       return obj;
   }
   ```

3. **peek()**: Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
   ```java
   public synchronized E peek() {
       int len = size();
       if (len == 0)
           throw new EmptyStackException();
       return elementAt(len - 1);
   }
   ```

4. **empty()**: Checks if the stack is empty.
   ```java
   public boolean empty() {
       return size() == 0;
   }
   ```

5. **search(Object o)**: Returns the 1-based position of the object in the stack. If the object is not found, it returns -1.
   ```java
   public synchronized int search(Object o) {
       int i = lastIndexOf(o);
       if (i >= 0) {
           return size() - i;
       }
       return -1;
   }
   ```

### Example Usage
Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use the `Stack` class in Java:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        // Push elements onto the stack
        stack.push(10);
        stack.push(20);
        stack.push(30);

        // Peek at the top element
        System.out.println("Top element: " + stack.peek());

        // Pop elements from the stack
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop());
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop());

        // Check if the stack is empty
        System.out.println("Is stack empty? " + stack.empty());

        // Search for an element
        stack.push(40);
        stack.push(50);
        System.out.println("Position of 40: " + stack.search(40));
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Simple to Use**: The `Stack` class provides a straightforward way to implement stack operations.
- **Built-in Methods**: Inherits useful methods from the `Vector` class.

### Disadvantages
- **Legacy Class**: The `Stack` class is considered a legacy class and is synchronized, which can lead to performance issues in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Alternative**: For better performance and more flexibility, consider using `Deque` implementations like `ArrayDeque` for stack operations.

# How Queues works internally In Java and list out all methods

In Java, the `Queue` interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and represents a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, although there are exceptions like `PriorityQueue` which orders elements based on their priority.

### Internal Working
The `Queue` interface is implemented by several classes, each with its own internal workings:

1. **LinkedList**: Implements `Queue` using a doubly linked list. Elements are added at the end and removed from the beginning.
2. **ArrayDeque**: Implements `Queue` using a resizable array. It provides better performance than `LinkedList` for most operations.
3. **PriorityQueue**: Implements `Queue` using a binary heap. Elements are ordered based on their natural ordering or by a comparator provided at queue construction time.
4. **ArrayBlockingQueue**: Implements `Queue` using a fixed-size array. It is a thread-safe implementation designed for use in concurrent programming.

### Key Methods
Here are some of the key methods provided by the `Queue` interface:

1. **offer(E e)**: Inserts the specified element into the queue if possible.
   ```java
   boolean offer(E e);
   ```

2. **poll()**: Retrieves and removes the head of the queue, or returns `null` if the queue is empty.
   ```java
   E poll();
   ```

3. **peek()**: Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue, or returns `null` if the queue is empty.
   ```java
   E peek();
   ```

4. **remove()**: Retrieves and removes the head of the queue. Throws an exception if the queue is empty.
   ```java
   E remove();
   ```

5. **element()**: Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue. Throws an exception if the queue is empty.
   ```java
   E element();
   ```

### Example Usage
Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use the `Queue` interface with a `LinkedList` implementation:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class QueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        // Add elements to the queue
        queue.offer(10);
        queue.offer(20);
        queue.offer(30);

        // Peek at the head of the queue
        System.out.println("Head of queue: " + queue.peek());

        // Remove elements from the queue
        System.out.println("Removed from queue: " + queue.poll());
        System.out.println("Removed from queue: " + queue.poll());

        // Check the head of the queue
        System.out.println("Head of queue: " + queue.peek());
    }
}
```

### Implementations and Their Methods
Different implementations of the `Queue` interface provide additional methods specific to their functionality. For example:

- **LinkedList**: Inherits methods from `List` and `Deque` interfaces.
- **ArrayDeque**: Provides methods like `addFirst`, `addLast`, `removeFirst`, `removeLast`.
- **PriorityQueue**: Provides methods like `comparator`, `iterator`, `toArray`.

For a comprehensive list of methods and detailed explanations, you can refer to the official Java documentation[1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-queue)[2](https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/java-queue-interface-and-implementations)[3](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/java-queue-interface/).

# How Tree data structure works internally 

In Java, a tree is a non-linear data structure used to represent hierarchical relationships. Trees are composed of nodes, where each node contains data and references to its child nodes. Here's a detailed look at the tree data structure and its methods:

### Components of a Tree
1. **Node**: The basic unit of a tree, containing data and references to child nodes.
2. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree, with no parent.
3. **Parent**: A node that has one or more child nodes.
4. **Child**: A node that has a parent node.
5. **Leaf**: A node with no children.
6. **Subtree**: A tree formed by a node and its descendants.
7. **Depth**: The number of edges from the root to a node.
8. **Height**: The number of edges from a node to the deepest leaf.

### Types of Trees
1. **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child contains values less than the parent, and the right child contains values greater than the parent.
3. **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree.
4. **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree with additional properties to ensure balance.
5. **B-Tree**: A self-balancing search tree for maintaining sorted data and allowing searches, insertions, deletions, and sequential access.

### Basic Operations
1. **Insertion**: Adding a new node to the tree.
2. **Deletion**: Removing a node from the tree.
3. **Traversal**: Visiting all the nodes in a specific order (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order).
4. **Searching**: Finding a node with a specific value.

### Example: Binary Search Tree (BST)
Here's a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree in Java:

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right;

    public Node(int item) {
        data = item;
        left = right = null;
    }
}

class BinarySearchTree {
    Node root;

    BinarySearchTree() {
        root = null;
    }

    void insert(int key) {
        root = insertRec(root, key);
    }

    Node insertRec(Node root, int key) {
        if (root == null) {
            root = new Node(key);
            return root;
        }
        if (key < root.data)
            root.left = insertRec(root.left, key);
        else if (key > root.data)
            root.right = insertRec(root.right, key);
        return root;
    }

    void inorder() {
        inorderRec(root);
    }

    void inorderRec(Node root) {
        if (root != null) {
            inorderRec(root.left);
            System.out.print(root.data + " ");
            inorderRec(root.right);
        }
    }

    Node search(Node root, int key) {
        if (root == null || root.data == key)
            return root;
        if (root.data > key)
            return search(root.left, key);
        return search(root.right, key);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BinarySearchTree tree = new BinarySearchTree();

        tree.insert(50);
        tree.insert(30);
        tree.insert(20);
        tree.insert(40);
        tree.insert(70);
        tree.insert(60);
        tree.insert(80);

        System.out.println("Inorder traversal of the given tree");
        tree.inorder();

        System.out.println("\n\nSearch for 40 in the tree");
        Node result = tree.search(tree.root, 40);
        if (result != null)
            System.out.println("Node found: " + result.data);
        else
            System.out.println("Node not found");
    }
}
```

### Methods in Tree Data Structures
- **insert(int key)**: Inserts a new node with the given key.
- **inorder()**: Performs an in-order traversal of the tree.
- **search(Node root, int key)**: Searches for a node with the given key.

### Advantages
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Ideal for representing hierarchical data.
- **Efficient Searching**: Binary search trees provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

### Disadvantages
- **Balancing**: Trees can become unbalanced, leading to inefficient operations. Self-balancing trees like AVL and Red-Black trees address this issue.

# How Binary Trees internally works in Java

In Java, a binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Here's a detailed look at how binary trees work internally:

### Structure
A binary tree is composed of nodes, where each node contains:
- **Data**: The value stored in the node.
- **Left Child**: A reference to the left child node.
- **Right Child**: A reference to the right child node.

Here's a basic implementation of a binary tree node in Java:

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right;

    public Node(int item) {
        data = item;
        left = right = null;
    }
}
```

### Binary Tree Class
The binary tree class typically contains a reference to the root node and methods to perform various operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

```java
public class BinaryTree {
    Node root;

    BinaryTree() {
        root = null;
    }
}
```

### Key Operations
1. **Insertion**: Adding a new node to the tree. In a binary search tree (BST), the new node is added in such a way that the left child contains values less than the parent node, and the right child contains values greater than the parent node.

```java
void insert(int key) {
    root = insertRec(root, key);
}

Node insertRec(Node root, int key) {
    if (root == null) {
        root = new Node(key);
        return root;
    }
    if (key < root.data)
        root.left = insertRec(root.left, key);
    else if (key > root.data)
        root.right = insertRec(root.right, key);
    return root;
}
```

2. **Traversal**: Visiting all the nodes in a specific order. Common traversal methods include:
   - **In-order**: Left, Root, Right
   - **Pre-order**: Root, Left, Right
   - **Post-order**: Left, Right, Root

```java
void inorder() {
    inorderRec(root);
}

void inorderRec(Node root) {
    if (root != null) {
        inorderRec(root.left);
        System.out.print(root.data + " ");
        inorderRec(root.right);
    }
}
```

3. **Searching**: Finding a node with a specific value. In a BST, this can be done efficiently by comparing the value with the current node and traversing left or right accordingly.

```java
Node search(Node root, int key) {
    if (root == null || root.data == key)
        return root;
    if (root.data > key)
        return search(root.left, key);
    return search(root.right, key);
}
```

### Example Usage
Here's how you can use the binary tree class to create a tree and perform some operations:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BinaryTree tree = new BinaryTree();

        tree.insert(50);
        tree.insert(30);
        tree.insert(20);
        tree.insert(40);
        tree.insert(70);
        tree.insert(60);
        tree.insert(80);

        System.out.println("In-order traversal of the given tree");
        tree.inorder();

        System.out.println("\n\nSearch for 40 in the tree");
        Node result = tree.search(tree.root, 40);
        if (result != null)
            System.out.println("Node found: " + result.data);
        else
            System.out.println("Node not found");
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Ideal for representing hierarchical data.
- **Efficient Searching**: Binary search trees provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

### Disadvantages
- **Balancing**: Trees can become unbalanced, leading to inefficient operations. Self-balancing trees like AVL and Red-Black trees address this issue.

# Binary Search Trees (BST) internally works in Java

In Java, a Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specialized form of a binary tree that maintains a sorted order of elements, enabling efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. Here's a detailed look at how BSTs work internally:

### Structure
A BST is composed of nodes, where each node contains:
- **Data**: The value stored in the node.
- **Left Child**: A reference to the left child node, which contains values less than the node's value.
- **Right Child**: A reference to the right child node, which contains values greater than the node's value.

Here's a basic implementation of a BST node in Java:

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right;

    public Node(int item) {
        data = item;
        left = right = null;
    }
}
```

### BST Class
The BST class typically contains a reference to the root node and methods to perform various operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

```java
public class BinarySearchTree {
    Node root;

    BinarySearchTree() {
        root = null;
    }
}
```

### Key Operations
1. **Insertion**: Adding a new node to the tree. The new node is added in such a way that the left child contains values less than the parent node, and the right child contains values greater than the parent node.

```java
void insert(int key) {
    root = insertRec(root, key);
}

Node insertRec(Node root, int key) {
    if (root == null) {
        root = new Node(key);
        return root;
    }
    if (key < root.data)
        root.left = insertRec(root.left, key);
    else if (key > root.data)
        root.right = insertRec(root.right, key);
    return root;
}
```

2. **Traversal**: Visiting all the nodes in a specific order. Common traversal methods include:
   - **In-order**: Left, Root, Right
   - **Pre-order**: Root, Left, Right
   - **Post-order**: Left, Right, Root

```java
void inorder() {
    inorderRec(root);
}

void inorderRec(Node root) {
    if (root != null) {
        inorderRec(root.left);
        System.out.print(root.data + " ");
        inorderRec(root.right);
    }
}
```

3. **Searching**: Finding a node with a specific value. In a BST, this can be done efficiently by comparing the value with the current node and traversing left or right accordingly.

```java
Node search(Node root, int key) {
    if (root == null || root.data == key)
        return root;
    if (root.data > key)
        return search(root.left, key);
    return search(root.right, key);
}
```

### Example Usage
Here's how you can use the BST class to create a tree and perform some operations:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BinarySearchTree tree = new BinarySearchTree();

        tree.insert(50);
        tree.insert(30);
        tree.insert(20);
        tree.insert(40);
        tree.insert(70);
        tree.insert(60);
        tree.insert(80);

        System.out.println("In-order traversal of the given tree");
        tree.inorder();

        System.out.println("\n\nSearch for 40 in the tree");
        Node result = tree.search(tree.root, 40);
        if (result != null)
            System.out.println("Node found: " + result.data);
        else
            System.out.println("Node not found");
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Efficient Searching**: BSTs provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
- **Sorted Order**: Elements are maintained in a sorted order, which is useful for various applications.

### Disadvantages
- **Balancing**: BSTs can become unbalanced, leading to inefficient operations. Self-balancing trees like AVL and Red-Black trees address this issue[1](https://favtutor.com/blogs/binary-search-tree-java)[2](https://geeksprogramming.com/bsts-java-comprehensive-guide/)[3](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/binary-search-tree-in-java/).

# How AVL Trees internally works in Java

In Java, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) named after its inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis. The AVL tree maintains its balance by ensuring that the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one. Here's a detailed look at how AVL trees work internally:

### Structure
An AVL tree is composed of nodes, where each node contains:
- **Data**: The value stored in the node.
- **Height**: The height of the node.
- **Left Child**: A reference to the left child node.
- **Right Child**: A reference to the right child node.

Here's a basic implementation of an AVL tree node in Java:

```java
class Node {
    int data, height;
    Node left, right;

    public Node(int item) {
        data = item;
        height = 1;
        left = right = null;
    }
}
```

### AVL Tree Class
The AVL tree class typically contains a reference to the root node and methods to perform various operations like insertion, deletion, and balancing.

```java
public class AVLTree {
    private Node root;

    // Method to get the height of the node
    int height(Node N) {
        if (N == null)
            return 0;
        return N.height;
    }

    // Method to get the balance factor of the node
    int getBalance(Node N) {
        if (N == null)
            return 0;
        return height(N.left) - height(N.right);
    }

    // Right rotate subtree rooted with y
    Node rightRotate(Node y) {
        Node x = y.left;
        Node T2 = x.right;

        // Perform rotation
        x.right = y;
        y.left = T2;

        // Update heights
        y.height = Math.max(height(y.left), height(y.right)) + 1;
        x.height = Math.max(height(x.left), height(x.right)) + 1;

        // Return new root
        return x;
    }

    // Left rotate subtree rooted with x
    Node leftRotate(Node x) {
        Node y = x.right;
        Node T2 = y.left;

        // Perform rotation
        y.left = x;
        x.right = T2;

        // Update heights
        x.height = Math.max(height(x.left), height(x.right)) + 1;
        y.height = Math.max(height(y.left), height(y.right)) + 1;

        // Return new root
        return y;
    }

    // Insert a node
    Node insert(Node node, int key) {
        // Perform the normal BST insertion
        if (node == null)
            return new Node(key);

        if (key < node.data)
            node.left = insert(node.left, key);
        else if (key > node.data)
            node.right = insert(node.right, key);
        else
            return node;

        // Update height of this ancestor node
        node.height = 1 + Math.max(height(node.left), height(node.right));

        // Get the balance factor of this ancestor node to check whether this node became unbalanced
        int balance = getBalance(node);

        // If this node becomes unbalanced, then there are 4 cases

        // Left Left Case
        if (balance > 1 && key < node.left.data)
            return rightRotate(node);

        // Right Right Case
        if (balance < -1 && key > node.right.data)
            return leftRotate(node);

        // Left Right Case
        if (balance > 1 && key > node.left.data) {
            node.left = leftRotate(node.left);
            return rightRotate(node);
        }

        // Right Left Case
        if (balance < -1 && key < node.right.data) {
            node.right = rightRotate(node.right);
            return leftRotate(node);
        }

        // Return the (unchanged) node pointer
        return node;
    }

    // Method to perform in-order traversal
    void inorder(Node node) {
        if (node != null) {
            inorder(node.left);
            System.out.print(node.data + " ");
            inorder(node.right);
        }
    }

    // Method to insert a key
    public void insert(int key) {
        root = insert(root, key);
    }

    // Method to perform in-order traversal
    public void inorder() {
        inorder(root);
    }
}
```

### Example Usage
Here's how you can use the AVL tree class to create a tree and perform some operations:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AVLTree tree = new AVLTree();

        tree.insert(10);
        tree.insert(20);
        tree.insert(30);
        tree.insert(40);
        tree.insert(50);
        tree.insert(25);

        System.out.println("In-order traversal of the constructed AVL tree is:");
        tree.inorder();
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Self-Balancing**: Ensures that the tree remains balanced, providing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
- **Efficient Operations**: Maintains O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: More complex to implement compared to simple binary search trees due to the need for balancing operations[1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-avl-trees)[2](https://www.javatpoint.com/avl-tree-program-in-java)[3](https://javadevjournal.com/data-structure/avl-tree/).

# How Red-Black Trees works internally in Java

Red-Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the tree remains balanced, providing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. Here's a detailed look at how Red-Black Trees work internally in Java:

### Structure
A Red-Black Tree is composed of nodes, where each node contains:
- **Data**: The value stored in the node.
- **Color**: Either red or black.
- **Left Child**: A reference to the left child node.
- **Right Child**: A reference to the right child node.
- **Parent**: A reference to the parent node.

### Properties
Red-Black Trees maintain the following properties to ensure balance:
1. **Each node is either red or black**.
2. **The root is always black**.
3. **All leaves (NIL nodes) are black**.
4. **If a node is red, then both its children are black** (no two red nodes can be adjacent).
5. **Every path from a node to its descendant NIL nodes has the same number of black nodes**.

### Key Operations
1. **Insertion**: When a new node is inserted, it is initially colored red. The tree is then adjusted to maintain the Red-Black properties through rotations and recoloring.
2. **Deletion**: When a node is deleted, the tree is adjusted to maintain the Red-Black properties. This may involve rotations and recoloring.
3. **Rotations**: Rotations are used to maintain the balance of the tree. There are two types of rotations:
   - **Left Rotation**: Moves a node down to the left.
   - **Right Rotation**: Moves a node down to the right.

### Example Implementation
Here's a simplified implementation of a Red-Black Tree in Java:

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right, parent;
    boolean color; // true for red, false for black

    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        left = right = parent = null;
        this.color = true; // New nodes are red by default
    }
}

public class RedBlackTree {
    private Node root;
    private Node TNULL;

    public RedBlackTree() {
        TNULL = new Node(0);
        TNULL.color = false;
        root = TNULL;
    }

    // Preorder traversal
    public void preOrder(Node node) {
        if (node != TNULL) {
            System.out.print(node.data + " ");
            preOrder(node.left);
            preOrder(node.right);
        }
    }

    // Inorder traversal
    public void inOrder(Node node) {
        if (node != TNULL) {
            inOrder(node.left);
            System.out.print(node.data + " ");
            inOrder(node.right);
        }
    }

    // Postorder traversal
    public void postOrder(Node node) {
        if (node != TNULL) {
            postOrder(node.left);
            postOrder(node.right);
            System.out.print(node.data + " ");
        }
    }

    // Balance the tree after deletion of a node
    private void fixDelete(Node x) {
        Node s;
        while (x != root && x.color == false) {
            if (x == x.parent.left) {
                s = x.parent.right;
                if (s.color == true) {

                    s = x.parent.right;
                }

                if (s.left.color == false && s.right.color == false) {
                    s.color = true;
                    x = x.parent;
                } else {
                    if (s.right.color == false) {
                        s.left.color = false;

                    s.color = x.parent.color;
                    x.parent.color = false;
                    s.right.color = false;
                    leftRotate(x.parent);
                    x = root;
                }

    public void insert(int key) {

    private void fixInsert(Node k) {

        while (k.parent.color == true) {
            if (k.parent == k.parent.parent.right) {
                u = k.parent.parent.left;
                if (u.color == true) {
                    u.color = false;
                    k.parent.color = false;
                    k.parent.parent.color = true;
                    k = k.parent.parent;
                } else {
                    if (k == k.parent.left) {
                        k = k.parent;
                        rightRotate(k);
                    }
                    k.parent.color = false;
                    k.parent.parent.color = true;
                    leftRotate(k.parent.parent);
                }
            } else {
                u = k.parent.parent.right;

                if (u.color == true) {
                    u.color = false;
                    k.parent.color = false;
                    k.parent.parent.color = true;
                    k = k.parent.parent;
                } else {
                    if (k == k.parent.right) {
                        k = k.parent;
                        leftRotate(k);
                    }
                    k.parent.color = false;
                    k.parent.parent.color = true;
                    rightRotate(k.parent.parent);
                }
            }
            if (k == root) {
                break;
            }
        }
        root.color = false;
    }

    // Print the tree structure on the screen
    public void printTree() {
        printHelper(this.root, "", true);
    }

    private void printHelper(Node root, String indent, boolean last) {
        if (root != TNULL) {
            System.out.print(indent);
            if (last) {
                System.out.print("R----");
                indent += "   ";
            } else {
                System.out.print("L----");
                indent += "|  ";
            }

            String sColor = root.color ? "RED" : "BLACK";
            System.out.println(root.data + "(" + sColor + ")");
            printHelper(root.left, indent, false);
            printHelper(root.right, indent, true);
        }
    }
}
```

### Example Usage
Here's how you can use the Red-Black Tree class to create a tree and perform some operations:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RedBlackTree tree = new RedBlackTree();

        tree.insert(55);
        tree.insert(40);
        tree.insert(65);
        tree.insert(60);
        tree.insert(75);
        tree.insert(57);

        System.out.println("In-order traversal of the constructed Red-Black Tree:");
        tree.inOrder(tree.root);

        System.out.println("\n\nTree structure:");
        tree.printTree();
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Self-Balancing**: Ensures that the tree remains balanced, providing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
- **Efficient Operations**: Maintains O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: More complex to implement compared to simple binary search trees due to the need for balancing operations[1](https://www.happycoders.eu/algorithms/red-black-tree-java/)[^2

# How Heaps works internally in Java

In Java, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues. There are two main types of heaps: **Min-Heaps** and **Max-Heaps**.

### Structure
A heap is typically implemented as a binary tree, but it is often represented using an array for simplicity and efficiency. Here's how the two types of heaps work:

1. **Min-Heap**: The value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent, with the minimum value at the root.
2. **Max-Heap**: The value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent, with the maximum value at the root.

### Array Representation
Heaps are usually represented as arrays. For a node at index `i`:
- The left child is at index `2*i + 1`.
- The right child is at index `2*i + 2`.
- The parent is at index `(i - 1) / 2`.

### Key Operations
1. **Insertion**: Add the new element at the end of the heap (array) and then "heapify up" to maintain the heap property by comparing the added element with its parent and swapping if necessary until the correct position is found.
   ```java
   void insert(int key) {
       heap[size] = key;
       int current = size;
       size++;
       while (heap[current] < heap[parent(current)]) {
           swap(current, parent(current));
           current = parent(current);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Deletion**: Remove the root element (minimum for a min-heap, maximum for a max-heap), replace it with the last element in the heap, and then "heapify down" by comparing the new root with its children and swapping if necessary until the correct position is found.
   ```java
   int extractMin() {
       int popped = heap[0];
       heap[0] = heap[--size];
       heapifyDown(0);
       return popped;
   }

   void heapifyDown(int i) {
       int smallest = i;
       int left = leftChild(i);
       int right = rightChild(i);

       if (left < size && heap[left] < heap[smallest])
           smallest = left;

       if (right < size && heap[right] < heap[smallest])
           smallest = right;

       if (smallest != i) {
           swap(i, smallest);
           heapifyDown(smallest);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Heapify**: Adjust the heap to maintain the heap property. In heapify-up, the newly added element is compared with its parent and swapped if needed. In heapify-down, the root element is compared with its children and swapped if needed.
   ```java
   void heapifyUp(int i) {
       while (i != 0 && heap[parent(i)] > heap[i]) {
           swap(i, parent(i));
           i = parent(i);
       }
   }
   ```

### Example Implementation
Here's a simple implementation of a Min-Heap in Java:

```java
public class MinHeap {
    private int[] heap;
    private int size;
    private int maxSize;

    public MinHeap(int maxSize) {
        this.maxSize = maxSize;
        this.size = 0;
        heap = new int[this.maxSize];
    }

    private int parent(int pos) { return (pos - 1) / 2; }
    private int leftChild(int pos) { return (2 * pos) + 1; }
    private int rightChild(int pos) { return (2 * pos) + 2; }

    private void swap(int fpos, int spos) {
        int tmp;
        tmp = heap[fpos];
        heap[fpos] = heap[spos];
        heap[spos] = tmp;
    }

    public void insert(int element) {
        heap[size] = element;
        int current = size;
        size++;
        heapifyUp(current);
    }

    private void heapifyUp(int pos) {
        int temp = heap[pos];
        while (pos > 0 && temp < heap[parent(pos)]) {
            heap[pos] = heap[parent(pos)];
            pos = parent(pos);
        }
        heap[pos] = temp;
    }

    public int extractMin() {
        int popped = heap[0];
        heap[0] = heap[--size];
        heapifyDown(0);
        return popped;
    }

    private void heapifyDown(int pos) {
        int smallest = pos;
        int left = leftChild(pos);
        int right = rightChild(pos);

        if (left < size && heap[left] < heap[smallest])
            smallest = left;

        if (right < size && heap[right] < heap[smallest])
            smallest = right;

        if (smallest != pos) {
            swap(pos, smallest);
            heapifyDown(smallest);
        }
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Efficient Operations**: Heaps provide efficient insertion, deletion, and access to the minimum or maximum element.
- **Priority Queues**: Ideal for implementing priority queues where quick access to the highest or lowest priority element is needed.

### Disadvantages
- **Not Ordered**: Unlike binary search trees, heaps do not maintain a sorted order of elements.
- **Balancing**: Requires balancing operations (heapify) to maintain the heap property[1](https://www.javatpoint.com/heap-implementation-in-java)[2](https://www.baeldung.com/java-stack-heap)[3](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/geninfo/diagnos/garbage_collect.html).

# How Tries internally works in Java

In Java, a Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-based data structure used for efficient retrieval of keys, typically strings. Tries are particularly useful for tasks like autocomplete and spell checking. Here's a detailed look at how Tries work internally:

### Structure
A Trie is composed of nodes, where each node contains:
- **Children**: A map or array of child nodes, each representing a character.
- **isEndOfWord**: A boolean flag indicating whether the node represents the end of a word.

Here's a basic implementation of a Trie node in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class TrieNode {
    Map<Character, TrieNode> children = new HashMap<>();
    boolean isEndOfWord;

    public TrieNode() {
        isEndOfWord = false;
    }
}
```

### Trie Class
The Trie class typically contains a reference to the root node and methods to perform various operations like insertion, search, and deletion.

```java
public class Trie {
    private TrieNode root;

    public Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
}
```

### Key Operations
1. **Insertion**: Adding a new word to the Trie. The word is broken down into characters, and each character is inserted into the Trie. If a character is not already present, a new node is created.

```java
public void insert(String word) {
    TrieNode current = root;
    for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
        current = current.children.computeIfAbsent(ch, c -> new TrieNode());
    }
    current.isEndOfWord = true;
}
```

2. **Search**: Checking if a word is present in the Trie. The word is broken down into characters, and each character is checked in the Trie. If all characters are found and the last node's `isEndOfWord` flag is true, the word exists in the Trie.

```java
public boolean search(String word) {
    TrieNode current = root;
    for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
        current = current.children.get(ch);
        if (current == null) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return current.isEndOfWord;
}
```

3. **Deletion**: Removing a word from the Trie. This involves checking if the word exists and then removing the nodes associated with the word, ensuring that no other words are affected.

```java
public void delete(String word) {
    delete(root, word, 0);
}

private boolean delete(TrieNode current, String word, int index) {
    if (index == word.length()) {
        if (!current.isEndOfWord) {
            return false;
        }
        current.isEndOfWord = false;
        return current.children.isEmpty();
    }
    char ch = word.charAt(index);
    TrieNode node = current.children.get(ch);
    if (node == null) {
        return false;
    }
    boolean shouldDeleteCurrentNode = delete(node, word, index + 1) && !node.isEndOfWord;

    if (shouldDeleteCurrentNode) {
        current.children.remove(ch);
        return current.children.isEmpty();
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Example Usage
Here's how you can use the Trie class to insert, search, and delete words:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Trie trie = new Trie();

        trie.insert("hello");
        trie.insert("world");

        System.out.println("Search 'hello': " + trie.search("hello")); // true
        System.out.println("Search 'world': " + trie.search("world")); // true
        System.out.println("Search 'java': " + trie.search("java"));   // false

        trie.delete("world");
        System.out.println("Search 'world' after deletion: " + trie.search("world")); // false
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Tries provide efficient retrieval of keys, especially for prefix-based searches.
- **Prefix Matching**: Ideal for applications like autocomplete and spell checking.

### Disadvantages
- **Memory Usage**: Tries can consume a lot of memory, especially if the alphabet size is large[1](https://www.baeldung.com/trie-java)[2](https://www.techiedelight.com/implement-trie-data-structure-java/)[3](https://dev.to/mlarocca/tries-3ddb).

# Graph Data structure in Java

A graph is a versatile data structure used to represent relationships between pairs of objects. It consists of vertices (or nodes) and edges (or arcs) that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs are widely used in various applications such as social networks, transportation networks, and computer networks.

### Components of a Graph
1. **Vertex (Node)**: Represents an entity, such as a person in a social network or a city in a transportation network.
2. **Edge (Arc)**: Represents a relationship or connection between two vertices, such as a friendship or a road.

### Types of Graphs
1. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship.
2. **Undirected Graph**: Edges do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship.
3. **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights, representing the cost or distance between vertices.
4. **Unweighted Graph**: Edges do not have weights.

### Graph Representations
1. **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where the element at row `i` and column `j` indicates the presence (and possibly the weight) of an edge between vertices `i` and `j`.
2. **Adjacency List**: An array of lists, where each list contains the neighbors of a vertex.

### Basic Operations
1. **Insertion**: Adding a vertex or an edge to the graph.
2. **Deletion**: Removing a vertex or an edge from the graph.
3. **Traversal**: Visiting all the vertices in the graph. Common traversal methods include:
   - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

### Example Implementation in Java
Here's a simple implementation of an undirected, unweighted graph using an adjacency list in Java:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

class Graph {
    private int V; // Number of vertices
    private LinkedList<Integer> adj[]; // Adjacency lists

    // Constructor
    Graph(int v) {
        V = v;
        adj = new LinkedList[v];
        for (int i = 0; i < v; ++i)
            adj[i] = new LinkedList();
    }

    // Method to add an edge into the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adj[v].add(w); // Add w to v's list.
        adj[w].add(v); // Add v to w's list (since the graph is undirected).
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal
    void DFSUtil(int v, boolean visited[]) {
        visited[v] = true;
        System.out.print(v + " ");

        for (int n : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[n])
                DFSUtil(n, visited);
        }
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal starting from a given vertex
    void DFS(int v) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        DFSUtil(v, visited);
    }

    // Method to perform BFS traversal
    void BFS(int s) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        LinkedList<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        visited[s] = true;
        queue.add(s);

        while (queue.size() != 0) {
            s = queue.poll();
            System.out.print(s + " ");

            for (int n : adj[s]) {
                if (!visited[n]) {
                    visited[n] = true;
                    queue.add(n);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Graph g = new Graph(4);

        g.addEdge(0, 1);
        g.addEdge(0, 2);
        g.addEdge(1, 2);
        g.addEdge(2, 3);

        System.out.println("Depth First Traversal starting from vertex 2:");
        g.DFS(2);

        System.out.println("\nBreadth First Traversal starting from vertex 2:");
        g.BFS(2);
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Versatile**: Can represent various types of relationships.
- **Efficient Traversal**: Algorithms like DFS and BFS allow efficient traversal and search.

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: Can be complex to implement and manage, especially for large graphs.
- **Memory Usage**: Can consume a lot of memory, especially with dense graphs[1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-graphs)[2](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-graph)[3](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/examples/graph-implementation).

# How Directed Graphs works internally in Java 

In Java, a directed graph (or digraph) is a type of graph where edges have a specific direction, indicating a one-way relationship between vertices. Here's a detailed look at how directed graphs work internally and how they can be implemented:

### Structure
A directed graph is composed of:
- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Represent entities or points.
- **Edges (Arcs)**: Represent directed connections between pairs of vertices.

### Representation
Directed graphs can be represented using various methods, with the most common being adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.

#### Adjacency List
An adjacency list represents the graph as an array of lists. Each list corresponds to a vertex and contains a list of its outgoing edges.

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

class Graph {
    private int V; // Number of vertices
    private LinkedList<Integer> adj[]; // Adjacency lists

    // Constructor
    Graph(int v) {
        V = v;
        adj = new LinkedList[v];
        for (int i = 0; i < v; ++i)
            adj[i] = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    // Method to add an edge into the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adj[v].add(w); // Add w to v's list.
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal
    void DFSUtil(int v, boolean visited[]) {
        visited[v] = true;
        System.out.print(v + " ");

        for (int n : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[n])
                DFSUtil(n, visited);
        }
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal starting from a given vertex
    void DFS(int v) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        DFSUtil(v, visited);
    }

    // Method to perform BFS traversal
    void BFS(int s) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        LinkedList<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        visited[s] = true;
        queue.add(s);

        while (queue.size() != 0) {
            s = queue.poll();
            System.out.print(s + " ");

            for (int n : adj[s]) {
                if (!visited[n]) {
                    visited[n] = true;
                    queue.add(n);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Adjacency Matrix
An adjacency matrix represents the graph as a 2D array. The element at row `i` and column `j` indicates the presence (and possibly the weight) of an edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.

```java
class Graph {
    private int V; // Number of vertices
    private int[][] adjMatrix; // Adjacency matrix

    // Constructor
    Graph(int v) {
        V = v;
        adjMatrix = new int[V][V];
    }

    // Method to add an edge into the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adjMatrix[v][w] = 1; // Add edge from v to w
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal
    void DFSUtil(int v, boolean visited[]) {
        visited[v] = true;
        System.out.print(v + " ");

        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (adjMatrix[v][i] == 1 && !visited[i])
                DFSUtil(i, visited);
        }
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal starting from a given vertex
    void DFS(int v) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        DFSUtil(v, visited);
    }

    // Method to perform BFS traversal
    void BFS(int s) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        LinkedList<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        visited[s] = true;
        queue.add(s);

        while (queue.size() != 0) {
            s = queue.poll();
            System.out.print(s + " ");

            for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
                if (adjMatrix[s][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
                    visited[i] = true;
                    queue.add(i);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Operations
1. **Insertion**: Adding a vertex or an edge to the graph.
2. **Deletion**: Removing a vertex or an edge from the graph.
3. **Traversal**: Visiting all the vertices in the graph using methods like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

### Example Usage
Here's how you can use the adjacency list representation to create a directed graph and perform some operations:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Graph g = new Graph(4);

        g.addEdge(0, 1);
        g.addEdge(0, 2);
        g.addEdge(1, 2);
        g.addEdge(2, 0);
        g.addEdge(2, 3);
        g.addEdge(3, 3);

        System.out.println("Depth First Traversal starting from vertex 2:");
        g.DFS(2);

        System.out.println("\nBreadth First Traversal starting from vertex 2:");
        g.BFS(2);
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Versatile**: Can represent various types of relationships.
- **Efficient Traversal**: Algorithms like DFS and BFS allow efficient traversal and search.

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: Can be complex to implement and manage, especially for large graphs.
- **Memory Usage**: Can consume a lot of memory, especially with dense graphs[1](https://codepal.ai/code-generator/query/ibv3Mxu9/java-code-implement-directed-graphs)[2](https://dev.to/wittedtech-by-harshit/the-ultimate-guide-to-graphs-in-java-a-deep-dive-for-developers-of-all-levels-fo1)[3](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/java-graph-tutorial/).

# How Undirected Graphs works internally in Java

In Java, an undirected graph is a type of graph where edges have no direction, meaning the relationship between vertices is bidirectional. Here's a detailed look at how undirected graphs work internally and how they can be implemented:

### Structure
An undirected graph is composed of:
- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Represent entities or points.
- **Edges (Arcs)**: Represent bidirectional connections between pairs of vertices.

### Representation
Undirected graphs can be represented using various methods, with the most common being adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.

#### Adjacency List
An adjacency list represents the graph as an array of lists. Each list corresponds to a vertex and contains a list of its adjacent vertices.

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

class Graph {
    private int V; // Number of vertices
    private LinkedList<Integer> adj[]; // Adjacency lists

    // Constructor
    Graph(int v) {
        V = v;
        adj = new LinkedList[v];
        for (int i = 0; i < v; ++i)
            adj[i] = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    // Method to add an edge into the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adj[v].add(w); // Add w to v's list.
        adj[w].add(v); // Add v to w's list (since the graph is undirected).
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal
    void DFSUtil(int v, boolean visited[]) {
        visited[v] = true;
        System.out.print(v + " ");

        for (int n : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[n])
                DFSUtil(n, visited);
        }
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal starting from a given vertex
    void DFS(int v) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        DFSUtil(v, visited);
    }

    // Method to perform BFS traversal
    void BFS(int s) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        LinkedList<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        visited[s] = true;
        queue.add(s);

        while (queue.size() != 0) {
            s = queue.poll();
            System.out.print(s + " ");

            for (int n : adj[s]) {
                if (!visited[n]) {
                    visited[n] = true;
                    queue.add(n);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Adjacency Matrix
An adjacency matrix represents the graph as a 2D array. The element at row `i` and column `j` indicates the presence (and possibly the weight) of an edge between vertices `i` and `j`.

    // Constructor
    Graph(int v) {

        adjMatrix = new int[V][V];
    }

    // Method to add an edge into the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adjMatrix[v][w] = 1; // Add edge from v to w
        adjMatrix[w][v] = 1; // Add edge from w to v (since the graph is undirected)
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal
    void DFSUtil(int v, boolean visited[]) {
        visited[v] = true;
        System.out.print(v + " ");

        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (adjMatrix[v][i] == 1 && !visited[i])
                DFSUtil(i, visited);
        }
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal starting from a given vertex
    void DFS(int v) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        DFSUtil(v, visited);
    }

    // Method to perform BFS traversal

                    visited[i] = true;
                    queue.add(i);

# How Weighted Graphs works internally in Java

In Java, a weighted graph is a type of graph where each edge has an associated weight or cost. These weights can represent various properties such as distance, time, or any other numerical value relevant to the problem being modeled. Here's a detailed look at how weighted graphs work internally and how they can be implemented:

### Structure
A weighted graph is composed of:
- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Represent entities or points.
- **Edges (Arcs)**: Represent connections between pairs of vertices, each with an associated weight.

### Representation
Weighted graphs can be represented using various methods, with the most common being adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.

#### Adjacency List
An adjacency list represents the graph as an array of lists. Each list corresponds to a vertex and contains a list of its adjacent vertices along with the weights of the edges connecting them.

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

class Graph {
    private int V; // Number of vertices
    private LinkedList<Edge>[] adj; // Adjacency lists

    // Edge class to represent an edge with a weight
    static class Edge {
        int destination;
        int weight;

        public Edge(int destination, int weight) {
            this.destination = destination;
            this.weight = weight;
        }
    }

    // Constructor
    Graph(int v) {
        V = v;
        adj = new LinkedList[v];
        for (int i = 0; i < v; ++i)
            adj[i] = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    // Method to add an edge into the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w, int weight) {
        adj[v].add(new Edge(w, weight)); // Add w to v's list with weight
        adj[w].add(new Edge(v, weight)); // Add v to w's list with weight (for undirected graph)
    }

    // Method to print the graph
    void printGraph() {
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            LinkedList<Edge> list = adj[i];
            System.out.print("Vertex " + i + " is connected to: ");
            for (Edge edge : list) {
                System.out.print(edge.destination + " (weight " + edge.weight + ") ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Adjacency Matrix
An adjacency matrix represents the graph as a 2D array. The element at row `i` and column `j` indicates the weight of the edge between vertices `i` and `j`. If there is no edge, the element is typically set to 0 or a large value (e.g., `Integer.MAX_VALUE`) to indicate the absence of a connection.

```java
class Graph {
    private int V; // Number of vertices
    private int[][] adjMatrix; // Adjacency matrix

    // Constructor
    Graph(int v) {
        V = v;
        adjMatrix = new int[V][V];
    }

    // Method to add an edge into the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w, int weight) {
        adjMatrix[v][w] = weight; // Add edge from v to w with weight
        adjMatrix[w][v] = weight; // Add edge from w to v with weight (for undirected graph)
    }

    // Method to print the graph
    void printGraph() {
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            System.out.print("Vertex " + i + " is connected to: ");
            for (int j = 0; j < V; j++) {
                if (adjMatrix[i][j] != 0) {
                    System.out.print(j + " (weight " + adjMatrix[i][j] + ") ");
                }
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Operations
1. **Insertion**: Adding a vertex or an edge with a weight to the graph.
2. **Deletion**: Removing a vertex or an edge from the graph.
3. **Traversal**: Visiting all the vertices in the graph using methods like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
4. **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford are used to find the shortest path between vertices in a weighted graph.

### Example Usage
Here's how you can use the adjacency list representation to create a weighted graph and perform some operations:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Graph g = new Graph(4);

        g.addEdge(0, 1, 5);
        g.addEdge(0, 2, 3);
        g.addEdge(1, 2, 2);
        g.addEdge(1, 3, 1);
        g.addEdge(2, 3, 4);

        System.out.println("Graph representation:");
        g.printGraph();
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Versatile**: Can represent various types of relationships with associated costs.
- **Efficient Traversal**: Algorithms like DFS and BFS allow efficient traversal and search.

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: Can be complex to implement and manage, especially for large graphs.
- **Memory Usage**: Can consume a lot of memory, especially with dense graphs[1](https://labex.io/tutorials/java-how-to-create-a-weighted-graph-in-java-413986)[2](https://tutorialhorizon.com/algorithms/weighted-graph-implementation-java/)[3](https://labex.io/tutorials/java-how-to-handle-graph-edge-weights-in-java-419112).

# How Unweighted Graphs works internally in Java

In Java, an unweighted graph is a type of graph where all edges are treated equally, meaning they do not have any associated weights or costs. Here's a detailed look at how unweighted graphs work internally and how they can be implemented:

### Structure
An unweighted graph is composed of:
- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Represent entities or points.
- **Edges (Arcs)**: Represent connections between pairs of vertices without any weights.

### Representation
Unweighted graphs can be represented using various methods, with the most common being adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.

#### Adjacency List
An adjacency list represents the graph as an array of lists. Each list corresponds to a vertex and contains a list of its adjacent vertices.

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

class Graph {
    private int V; // Number of vertices
    private LinkedList<Integer> adj[]; // Adjacency lists

    // Constructor
    Graph(int v) {
        V = v;
        adj = new LinkedList[v];
        for (int i = 0; i < v; ++i)
            adj[i] = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    // Method to add an edge into the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adj[v].add(w); // Add w to v's list.
        adj[w].add(v); // Add v to w's list (since the graph is undirected).
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal
    void DFSUtil(int v, boolean visited[]) {
        visited[v] = true;
        System.out.print(v + " ");

        for (int n : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[n])
                DFSUtil(n, visited);
        }
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal starting from a given vertex
    void DFS(int v) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        DFSUtil(v, visited);
    }

    // Method to perform BFS traversal
    void BFS(int s) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        LinkedList<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        visited[s] = true;
        queue.add(s);

        while (queue.size() != 0) {
            s = queue.poll();
            System.out.print(s + " ");

            for (int n : adj[s]) {
                if (!visited[n]) {
                    visited[n] = true;
                    queue.add(n);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Adjacency Matrix
An adjacency matrix represents the graph as a 2D array. The element at row `i` and column `j` indicates the presence of an edge between vertices `i` and `j`. If there is no edge, the element is typically set to 0.

```java
class Graph {
    private int V; // Number of vertices
    private int[][] adjMatrix; // Adjacency matrix

    // Constructor
    Graph(int v) {
        V = v;
        adjMatrix = new int[V][V];
    }

    // Method to add an edge into the graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adjMatrix[v][w] = 1; // Add edge from v to w
        adjMatrix[w][v] = 1; // Add edge from w to v (since the graph is undirected)
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal
    void DFSUtil(int v, boolean visited[]) {
        visited[v] = true;
        System.out.print(v + " ");

        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (adjMatrix[v][i] == 1 && !visited[i])
                DFSUtil(i, visited);
        }
    }

    // Method to perform DFS traversal starting from a given vertex
    void DFS(int v) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        DFSUtil(v, visited);
    }

    // Method to perform BFS traversal
    void BFS(int s) {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        LinkedList<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        visited[s] = true;
        queue.add(s);

        while (queue.size() != 0) {
            s = queue.poll();
            System.out.print(s + " ");

            for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
                if (adjMatrix[s][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
                    visited[i] = true;
                    queue.add(i);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Operations
1. **Insertion**: Adding a vertex or an edge to the graph.
2. **Deletion**: Removing a vertex or an edge from the graph.
3. **Traversal**: Visiting all the vertices in the graph using methods like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

### Example Usage
Here's how you can use the adjacency list representation to create an unweighted graph and perform some operations:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Graph g = new Graph(4);

        g.addEdge(0, 1);
        g.addEdge(0, 2);
        g.addEdge(1, 2);
        g.addEdge(2, 3);

        System.out.println("Depth First Traversal starting from vertex 2:");
        g.DFS(2);

        System.out.println("\nBreadth First Traversal starting from vertex 2:");
        g.BFS(2);
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Versatile**: Can represent various types of relationships.
- **Efficient Traversal**: Algorithms like DFS and BFS allow efficient traversal and search.

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: Can be complex to implement and manage, especially for large graphs.
- **Memory Usage**: Can consume a lot of memory, especially with dense graphs[1](https://jgrapht.org/javadoc/org.jgrapht.core/org/jgrapht/graph/AsUnweightedGraph.html)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43327156/how-to-represent-a-unweight-directed-graph-and-find-the-shortest-path-java)[3](https://dev.to/wittedtech-by-harshit/the-ultimate-guide-to-graphs-in-java-a-deep-dive-for-developers-of-all-levels-fo1).

# How Hash-Based Structures works

Hash-based data structures use hash functions to map keys to specific locations in a data structure, allowing for efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion. Here's a detailed look at how hash-based structures work:

### Core Concepts
1. **Hash Function**: A mathematical algorithm that transforms input data (keys) into a fixed-size numerical value, called a hash code. The hash code is used to index into an array, where the actual data is stored.
   - **Deterministic**: The same input will always produce the same hash code.
   - **Uniform Distribution**: Ideally, hash codes should be uniformly distributed to minimize collisions.
   - **Fixed Size**: The output hash code is of a fixed size, regardless of the input size.

2. **Hash Table**: The primary data structure used in hash-based structures. It consists of an array where each index corresponds to a hash code generated by the hash function.

### Key Operations
1. **Insertion**: The hash function is applied to the key to determine the index in the hash table where the value should be stored.
   ```java
   public void put(K key, V value) {
       int index = hash(key);
       table[index] = value;
   }
   ```

2. **Search**: The hash function is applied to the key to determine the index in the hash table where the value is stored.
   ```java
   public V get(K key) {
       int index = hash(key);
       return table[index];
   }
   ```

3. **Deletion**: The hash function is applied to the key to determine the index in the hash table where the value is stored, and the value is removed.
   ```java
   public void remove(K key) {
       int index = hash(key);
       table[index] = null;
   }
   ```

### Handling Collisions
Collisions occur when two different keys produce the same hash code. There are several strategies to handle collisions:

1. **Chaining**: Each index in the hash table points to a linked list of entries that have the same hash code.
   ```java
   class HashTable {
       private LinkedList<Entry>[] table;

       public void put(K key, V value) {
           int index = hash(key);
           if (table[index] == null) {
               table[index] = new LinkedList<>();
           }
           table[index].add(new Entry(key, value));
       }

       public V get(K key) {
           int index = hash(key);
           if (table[index] != null) {
               for (Entry entry : table[index]) {
                   if (entry.key.equals(key)) {
                       return entry.value;
                   }
               }
           }
           return null;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Open Addressing**: When a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot in the hash table.
   - **Linear Probing**: Searches sequentially for the next available slot.
   - **Quadratic Probing**: Searches using a quadratic function to find the next available slot.
   - **Double Hashing**: Uses a second hash function to determine the step size for finding the next available slot.

### Example: HashMap in Java
The `HashMap` class in Java is a widely used hash-based data structure that implements the `Map` interface. It uses an array of linked lists to handle collisions (chaining).

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Insertion
        map.put("apple", 1);
        map.put("banana", 2);
        map.put("cherry", 3);

        // Search
        System.out.println("Value for 'apple': " + map.get("apple"));

        // Deletion
        map.remove("banana");
        System.out.println("Value for 'banana': " + map.get("banana"));
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Efficient Operations**: Provides average-case O(1) time complexity for insertion, search, and deletion.
- **Scalability**: Can handle large datasets efficiently.

### Disadvantages
- **Collisions**: Requires strategies to handle collisions, which can affect performance.
- **Memory Usage**: Can consume more memory due to the need for additional data structures to handle collisions[1](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/hashing)[2](https://www.scholarhat.com/tutorial/datastructures/hashing-in-data-structures)[3](https://www.theknowledgeacademy.com/blog/hashing-in-data-structure/).

# How Hash Tables works in Java

In Java, a hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows for efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion. The `Hashtable` class in Java is part of the `java.util` package and implements the `Map` interface. Here's a detailed look at how hash tables work internally:

### Structure
A hash table consists of an array of "buckets" or "slots," where each bucket can store multiple key-value pairs. The position of each key-value pair in the array is determined by a hash function applied to the key.

### Key Components
1. **Hash Function**: A function that takes a key and returns an index in the array. The goal is to distribute keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions.
   ```java
   int hash(Object key) {
       return key.hashCode() % capacity;
   }
   ```

2. **Buckets**: Each bucket can store multiple key-value pairs. In Java's `Hashtable`, each bucket is typically implemented as a linked list to handle collisions.

### Key Operations
1. **Insertion**: The hash function is applied to the key to determine the index in the array where the key-value pair should be stored. If the bucket at that index is already occupied, the new key-value pair is added to the linked list at that bucket.
   ```java
   public void put(K key, V value) {
       int index = hash(key);
       Entry<K, V> newEntry = new Entry<>(key, value, null);
       if (table[index] == null) {
           table[index] = newEntry;
       } else {
           Entry<K, V> current = table[index];
           while (current.next != null) {
               if (current.key.equals(key)) {
                   current.value = value;
                   return;
               }
               current = current.next;
           }
           current.next = newEntry;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Search**: The hash function is applied to the key to determine the index in the array where the key-value pair is stored. The linked list at that bucket is then searched for the key.
   ```java
   public V get(Object key) {
       int index = hash(key);
       Entry<K, V> current = table[index];
       while (current != null) {
           if (current.key.equals(key)) {
               return current.value;
           }
           current = current.next;
       }
       return null;
   }
   ```

3. **Deletion**: The hash function is applied to the key to determine the index in the array where the key-value pair is stored. The linked list at that bucket is then searched for the key, and the key-value pair is removed.
   ```java
   public V remove(Object key) {
       int index = hash(key);
       Entry<K, V> current = table[index];
       Entry<K, V> previous = null;
       while (current != null) {
           if (current.key.equals(key)) {
               if (previous == null) {
                   table[index] = current.next;
               } else {
                   previous.next = current.next;
               }
               return current.value;
           }
           previous = current;
           current = current.next;
       }
       return null;
   }
   ```

### Handling Collisions
Collisions occur when two different keys produce the same hash code. In Java's `Hashtable`, collisions are handled using chaining, where each bucket contains a linked list of entries that have the same hash code.

### Example: Hashtable in Java
Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use the `Hashtable` class in Java:

```java
import java.util.Hashtable;

public class HashtableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Hashtable<String, Integer> hashtable = new Hashtable<>();

        // Insertion
        hashtable.put("apple", 1);
        hashtable.put("banana", 2);
        hashtable.put("cherry", 3);

        // Search
        System.out.println("Value for 'apple': " + hashtable.get("apple"));

        // Deletion
        hashtable.remove("banana");
        System.out.println("Value for 'banana': " + hashtable.get("banana"));
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Efficient Operations**: Provides average-case O(1) time complexity for insertion, search, and deletion.
- **Thread-Safe**: The `Hashtable` class is synchronized, making it thread-safe for concurrent access.

### Disadvantages
- **Synchronization Overhead**: The synchronization can slow down performance in single-threaded environments.
- **No Null Keys or Values**: The `Hashtable` class does not allow null keys or values[1](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-hashtable)[2](https://howtodoinjava.com/java/collections/hashtable-class/)[3](https://www.baeldung.com/java-hash-table).

# How Hash Maps works internally in Java

In Java, a `HashMap` is a widely used data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows for efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion. Here's a detailed look at how `HashMap` works internally:

### Structure
A `HashMap` consists of an array of "buckets" or "bins," where each bucket can store multiple key-value pairs. The position of each key-value pair in the array is determined by a hash function applied to the key.

### Key Components
1. **Hash Function**: A function that takes a key and returns an index in the array. The goal is to distribute keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions.

   ```java
   public void put(K key, V value) {
       int index = hash(key);
       Node<K, V> newNode = new Node<>(key, value, null);
       if (table[index] == null) {
           table[index] = newNode;
       } else {
           Node<K, V> current = table[index];
           while (current.next != null) {
               if (current.key.equals(key)) {
                   current.value = value;
                   return;
               }
               current = current.next;
           }
           current.next = newNode;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Search**: The hash function is applied to the key to determine the index in the array where the key-value pair is stored. The linked list at that bucket is then searched for the key.
   ```java
   public V get(Object key) {
       int index = hash(key);
       Node<K, V> current = table[index];
       while (current != null) {
           if (current.key.equals(key)) {
               return current.value;
           }
           current = current.next;
       }
       return null;
   }
   ```

3. **Deletion**: The hash function is applied to the key to determine the index in the array where the key-value pair is stored, and the key-value pair is removed.
   ```java

       int index = hash(key);
       Node<K, V> current = table[index];
       Node<K, V> previous = null;
       while (current != null) {
           if (current.key.equals(key)) {
               if (previous == null) {
                   table[index] = current.next;
               } else {
                   previous.next = current.next;
               }
               return current.value;
           }
           previous = current;
           current = current.next;
       }
       return null;
   }
   ```

### Handling Collisions
Collisions occur when two different keys produce the same hash code. In Java's `HashMap`, collisions are handled using chaining, where each bucket contains a linked list of entries that have the same hash code. Starting from Java 8, if the number of entries in a bucket exceeds a certain threshold (TREEIFY_THRESHOLD, default value 8), the linked list is converted to a balanced tree (Red-Black Tree) to improve performance[1](https://howtodoinjava.com/java/collections/hashmap/how-hashmap-works-in-java/)[2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-java-hashmaps-work-internal-mechanics-explained/).

### Example: HashMap in Java
Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use the `HashMap` class in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Insertion
        map.put("apple", 1);
        map.put("banana", 2);
        map.put("cherry", 3);

        // Search
        System.out.println("Value for 'apple': " + map.get("apple"));

        // Deletion
        map.remove("banana");
        System.out.println("Value for 'banana': " + map.get("banana"));
    }
}
```

### Advantages
- **Efficient Operations**: Provides average-case O(1) time complexity for insertion, search, and deletion.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Automatically resizes when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold to maintain performance.

### Disadvantages
- **Memory Usage**: Can consume more memory due to the need for additional data structures to handle collisions.
- **No Null Keys or Values**: Unlike `Hashtable`, `HashMap` allows one null key and multiple null values[1](https://howtodoinjava.com/java/collections/hashmap/how-hashmap-works-in-java/)[2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-java-hashmaps-work-internal-mechanics-explained/)[3](https://www.javatpoint.com/working-of-hashmap-in-java).

# How Segment Trees works internally in Java

Segment Trees are a powerful data structure used for efficiently solving range queries and updates on arrays. Here's a brief overview of how they work internally in Java:

### Structure of a Segment Tree
1. **Tree Representation**: A Segment Tree is a binary tree where each node represents a segment (or range) of the array. The leaf nodes represent individual elements of the array, while internal nodes represent the sum (or other operations) of their child nodes.
2. **Array Representation**: Segment Trees can be represented using arrays. For an array of size \( n \), the Segment Tree can be represented in an array of size \( 2 \times 2^{\lceil \log_2 n \rceil} - 1 \).

### Building the Segment Tree
1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing an array to store the Segment Tree.
2. **Recursive Construction**: Build the tree recursively. The root node represents the entire array, and each internal node represents a segment of the array. The left child of a node at index \( i \) is at \( 2i + 1 \) and the right child is at \( 2i + 2 \).

### Operations on Segment Tree
1. **Range Query**: To find the sum (or other operations) of elements in a given range, traverse the tree from the root, checking if the current segment overlaps with the query range. If it does, combine the results from the left and right children.
2. **Update**: To update an element, find the corresponding leaf node and update its value. Then, propagate the changes up the tree by updating the values of the internal nodes.

### Example Code in Java
Here's a simple implementation of a Segment Tree in Java:

```java
class SegmentTree {
    int[] tree;
    int n;

    public SegmentTree(int[] arr) {
        n = arr.length;
        tree = new int[2 * n];
        buildTree(arr);
    }

    private void buildTree(int[] arr) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tree[n + i] = arr[i];
        }
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
            tree[i] = tree[2 * i] + tree[2 * i + 1];
        }
    }

    public void update(int pos, int value) {
        pos += n;
        tree[pos] = value;
        while (pos > 1) {
            pos /= 2;
            tree[pos] = tree[2 * pos] + tree[2 * pos + 1];
        }
    }

    public int query(int left, int right) {
        left += n;
        right += n;
        int sum = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            if ((left & 1) == 1) {
                sum += tree[left++];
            }
            if ((right & 1) == 1) {
                sum += tree[--right];
            }
            left /= 2;
            right /= 2;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

# How Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees) works internally in Java

Fenwick Trees, also known as Binary Indexed Trees (BIT), are a data structure that efficiently supports range queries and updates. Here's a breakdown of how they work internally in Java:

### Structure of a Fenwick Tree
1. **Tree Representation**: A Fenwick Tree is represented as an array where each element at index \( i \) stores the cumulative frequency or sum of elements up to that index.
2. **Indexing**: The key idea is to use the binary representation of indices to determine the range of elements each node covers.

### Operations on Fenwick Tree
1. **Update Operation**: To update an element, you need to update all the relevant nodes that include this element in their range.
2. **Query Operation**: To get the sum of elements up to a given index, you sum the values of all relevant nodes that contribute to this range.

### Example Code in Java
Here's a simple implementation of a Fenwick Tree in Java:

```java
class FenwickTree {
    private int[] tree;
    private int n;

    public FenwickTree(int size) {
        this.n = size;
        this.tree = new int[n + 1];
    }

    // Update the Fenwick Tree with value at position index
    public void update(int index, int value) {
        while (index <= n) {
            tree[index] += value;
            index += index & -index;
        }
    }

    // Query the sum of the range [1, index]
    public int query(int index) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (index > 0) {
            sum += tree[index];
            index -= index & -index;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    // Query the sum of the range [left, right]
    public int rangeQuery(int left, int right) {
        return query(right) - query(left - 1);
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Update Operation**: The `update` method adds a value to the element at the given index and updates all relevant nodes. The expression `index += index & -index` moves to the next node that includes the current index in its range.
2. **Query Operation**: The `query` method calculates the sum of elements up to the given index by summing the values of all relevant nodes. The expression `index -= index & -index` moves to the parent node.

### Usage
- **Initialization**: Create an instance of `FenwickTree` with the size of the array.
- **Update**: Use the `update` method to add a value to an element.
- **Query**: Use the `query` method to get the sum of elements up to a given index or `rangeQuery` for a specific range.

Fenwick Trees are highly efficient, with both update and query operations having a time complexity of \( O(\log n) \)[1](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/fenwick-tree)[2](https://www.wscubetech.com/resources/dsa/fenwick-tree).

# How Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) works internally in Java

Disjoint Set Union, also known as Union-Find, is a data structure that efficiently handles the union and find operations on disjoint sets. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works internally in Java:

### Structure of Disjoint Set Union
1. **Parent Array**: Each element points to its parent, and a root element points to itself.
2. **Rank Array**: This helps in keeping the tree flat by attaching the smaller tree under the root of the larger tree.

### Operations on Disjoint Set Union
1. **Find Operation**: Determines the root of the set containing a particular element. This operation uses path compression to make future queries faster.
2. **Union Operation**: Merges two sets into one. This operation uses union by rank to keep the tree flat.

### Example Code in Java
Here's a simple implementation of Disjoint Set Union in Java:

```java
class DisjointSetUnion {
    private int[] parent;
    private int[] rank;

    public DisjointSetUnion(int size) {
        parent = new int[size];
        rank = new int[size];
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
            rank[i] = 0;
        }
    }

    // Find the root of the set containing element x
    public int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // Path compression
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    // Union of two sets containing elements x and y
    public void union(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);

        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The `parent` array is initialized such that each element is its own parent, and the `rank` array is initialized to zero.
2. **Find Operation**: The `find` method uses path compression to make the tree flatter, which speeds up future operations.
3. **Union Operation**: The `union` method uses union by rank to attach the smaller tree under the root of the larger tree, ensuring the tree remains balanced.

### Usage
- **Initialization**: Create an instance of `DisjointSetUnion` with the size of the set.
- **Union**: Use the `union` method to merge two sets.
- **Find**: Use the `find` method to determine the root of the set containing a particular element.

Disjoint Set Union is highly efficient, with both union and find operations having an average time complexity of \( O(\log n) \) due to path compression and union by rank[1](https://www.javatpoint.com/disjoint-set-data-structure)[2](https://automationtestlab.com/disjoint-sets-in-java/).

# How Multimaps works internally in Java

Multimaps in Java are a type of data structure that allows a single key to be associated with multiple values, unlike traditional maps where each key is associated with a single value. Java does not have a built-in Multimap implementation, but you can use libraries like Google's Guava or Apache Commons Collections to achieve this functionality.

### Structure of a Multimap
1. **Key-Value Mapping**: In a Multimap, each key can map to multiple values. This is similar to having a `Map<K, Collection<V>>`, where each key maps to a collection of values.
2. **Implementation**: Common implementations include `ArrayListMultimap`, `HashMultimap`, `LinkedListMultimap`, and `TreeMultimap` from the Guava library.

### Operations on Multimap
1. **Put Operation**: Adds a key-value pair to the multimap. If the key already exists, the value is added to the collection of values for that key.
2. **Get Operation**: Retrieves the collection of values associated with a key.
3. **Remove Operation**: Removes a specific key-value pair or all values associated with a key.

### Example Code in Java using Guava
Here's a simple implementation of a Multimap using the Guava library:

```java
import com.google.common.collect.ArrayListMultimap;
import com.google.common.collect.Multimap;

public class MultimapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Multimap<String, String> multimap = ArrayListMultimap.create();

        // Adding key-value pairs
        multimap.put("a", "Andrew");
        multimap.put("b", "Albert");
        multimap.put("b", "Tom");
        multimap.put("d", "Sam");
        multimap.put("d", "Reo");
        multimap.put("g", "Jack");
        multimap.put("g", "David");

        // Retrieving values
        System.out.println("Values for key 'b': " + multimap.get("b"));

        // Removing a key-value pair
        multimap.remove("b", "Tom");
        System.out.println("Values for key 'b' after removal: " + multimap.get("b"));
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The `ArrayListMultimap.create()` method creates a new instance of a Multimap.
2. **Put Operation**: The `put` method adds key-value pairs to the multimap.
3. **Get Operation**: The `get` method retrieves the collection of values associated with a key.
4. **Remove Operation**: The `remove` method removes a specific key-value pair from the multimap.

### Custom Implementation
If you prefer not to use external libraries, you can implement your own Multimap using a `Map<K, Collection<V>>`:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CustomMultimap<K, V> {
    private Map<K, Collection<V>> map = new HashMap<>();

    public void put(K key, V value) {
        map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(value);
    }

    public Collection<V> get(K key) {
        return map.getOrDefault(key, Collections.emptyList());
    }

    public void remove(K key, V value) {
        Collection<V> values = map.get(key);
        if (values != null) {
            values.remove(value);
            if (values.isEmpty()) {
                map.remove(key);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CustomMultimap<String, String> multimap = new CustomMultimap<>();

        // Adding key-value pairs
        multimap.put("a", "Andrew");
        multimap.put("b", "Albert");
        multimap.put("b", "Tom");
        multimap.put("d", "Sam");
        multimap.put("d", "Reo");
        multimap.put("g", "Jack");
        multimap.put("g", "David");

        // Retrieving values
        System.out.println("Values for key 'b': " + multimap.get("b"));

        // Removing a key-value pair
        multimap.remove("b", "Tom");
        System.out.println("Values for key 'b' after removal: " + multimap.get("b"));
    }
}
```

This custom implementation uses a `HashMap` to store the keys and an `ArrayList` to store the values for each key.

Multimaps are useful in scenarios where you need to associate multiple values with a single key, such as in database indexing or grouping data[1](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-8-multimap)[2](https://redisson.org/glossary/java-multimap.html).

# How Multisets (Bags) works internally in Java

Multisets, also known as Bags, are a type of collection that allows duplicate elements. Unlike a standard Set, which only allows unique elements, a Multiset can store multiple occurrences of the same element. Java does not have a built-in Multiset implementation, but you can use libraries like Google's Guava or Apache Commons Collections to achieve this functionality.

### Structure of a Multiset
1. **Element Storage**: A Multiset stores elements along with their counts. This can be implemented using a `Map<E, Integer>`, where the key is the element and the value is the count of that element.
2. **Count Management**: The count of each element is managed internally, allowing for efficient addition, removal, and querying of elements.

### Operations on Multiset
1. **Add Operation**: Adds an element to the multiset and increments its count.
2. **Remove Operation**: Removes an element from the multiset and decrements its count.
3. **Count Operation**: Retrieves the count of a specific element in the multiset.

### Example Code in Java using Guava
Here's a simple implementation of a Multiset using the Guava library:

```java
import com.google.common.collect.HashMultiset;
import com.google.common.collect.Multiset;

public class MultisetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Multiset<String> multiset = HashMultiset.create();

        // Adding elements
        multiset.add("apple");
        multiset.add("banana");
        multiset.add("apple");
        multiset.add("orange");
        multiset.add("banana");
        multiset.add("apple");

        // Retrieving counts
        System.out.println("Count of 'apple': " + multiset.count("apple"));
        System.out.println("Count of 'banana': " + multiset.count("banana"));
        System.out.println("Count of 'orange': " + multiset.count("orange"));

        // Removing elements
        multiset.remove("apple");
        System.out.println("Count of 'apple' after removal: " + multiset.count("apple"));
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The `HashMultiset.create()` method creates a new instance of a Multiset.
2. **Add Operation**: The `add` method adds elements to the multiset and increments their counts.
3. **Count Operation**: The `count` method retrieves the count of a specific element.
4. **Remove Operation**: The `remove` method removes an element from the multiset and decrements its count.

### Custom Implementation
If you prefer not to use external libraries, you can implement your own Multiset using a `HashMap`:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class CustomMultiset<E> {
    private Map<E, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

    public void add(E element) {
        map.put(element, map.getOrDefault(element, 0) + 1);
    }

    public void remove(E element) {
        if (map.containsKey(element)) {
            if (map.get(element) > 1) {
                map.put(element, map.get(element) - 1);
            } else {
                map.remove(element);
            }
        }
    }

    public int count(E element) {
        return map.getOrDefault(element, 0);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CustomMultiset<String> multiset = new CustomMultiset<>();

        // Adding elements
        multiset.add("apple");
        multiset.add("banana");
        multiset.add("apple");
        multiset.add("orange");
        multiset.add("banana");
        multiset.add("apple");

        // Retrieving counts
        System.out.println("Count of 'apple': " + multiset.count("apple"));
        System.out.println("Count of 'banana': " + multiset.count("banana"));
        System.out.println("Count of 'orange': " + multiset.count("orange"));

        // Removing elements
        multiset.remove("apple");
        System.out.println("Count of 'apple' after removal: " + multiset.count("apple"));
    }
}
```

This custom implementation uses a `HashMap` to store elements and their counts, providing a simple and efficient way to manage a Multiset.

Multisets are useful in scenarios where you need to count occurrences of elements, such as in frequency analysis or inventory management[1](https://www.techiedelight.com/multiset-implementation-java/)[2](https://jminded.com/bag-multiset-implementation-with-linkedlist-in-java/).

# What is Fibonacci Heap data structure in Java

A Fibonacci heap is a data structure used for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees. It was invented by Michael L. Fredman and Robert E. Tarjan in 1984 and is named after the Fibonacci numbers, which are used in its running time analysis[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap)[2](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/fibonacci-heap).

### Key Properties
1. **Heap-Ordered Trees**: The trees in a Fibonacci heap follow the min-heap or max-heap property, meaning the key of a child is always greater than or equal to the key of the parent.
2. **Flexible Structure**: Unlike binomial heaps, Fibonacci heaps do not have a rigid structure. This flexibility allows some operations to be executed lazily, postponing work for later operations.
3. **Amortized Time Complexity**: Fibonacci heaps have better amortized running times for many operations compared to other heap data structures. For example:
   - **Insert**: \( O(1) \)
   - **Find-Min**: \( O(1) \)
   - **Delete-Min**: \( O(\log n) \)
   - **Decrease-Key**: \( O(1) \)
   - **Merge**: \( O(1) \)

### Operations
1. **Insertion**: Adding a new node to the heap is done in constant time by simply adding it to the root list.
2. **Find-Min**: The minimum element is always at the root of one of the trees, so it can be found in constant time.
3. **Union**: Merging two Fibonacci heaps is done by concatenating their root lists, which takes constant time.
4. **Extract-Min**: Removing the minimum element involves removing the root of the tree containing the minimum element and then consolidating the trees to maintain the heap properties.
5. **Decrease-Key**: Decreasing the key of a node may involve cutting the node from its parent and adding it to the root list, followed by a cascading cut if necessary.
6. **Delete**: Deleting a node is done by decreasing its key to negative infinity and then performing an extract-min operation.

### Example Structure
A Fibonacci heap is a collection of trees where each tree is a min-heap. The roots of all trees are linked together in a circular doubly linked list for efficient access. The child nodes of a parent node are also connected in a circular doubly linked list[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap)[2](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/fibonacci-heap).

### Advantages
- **Efficient Amortized Time**: Many operations have very efficient amortized time complexities, making Fibonacci heaps suitable for algorithms that require frequent priority queue operations, such as Dijkstra's and Prim's algorithms.
- **Lazy Operations**: Some operations are performed lazily, which can lead to better performance in practice.

Fibonacci heaps are particularly useful in scenarios where the decrease-key operation is frequently used, as they offer a significant performance improvement over other heap data structures[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap)[2](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/fibonacci-heap).

# Design a O(1) data structure

Designing a data structure that supports O(1) operations for insertion, deletion, and access can be quite challenging but is achievable with the right approach. One well-known example is the **All O`one Data Structure**, which supports the following operations in constant time:

1. **Insert**: Insert a new key with a value.
2. **Delete**: Remove a key.
3. **GetMaxKey**: Retrieve the key with the maximum value.
4. **GetMinKey**: Retrieve the key with the minimum value.

### Design Overview
To achieve O(1) time complexity for these operations, we can use a combination of a **HashMap** and a **Doubly Linked List**.

1. **HashMap**: This will store the keys and their corresponding nodes in the doubly linked list.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: This will store the keys grouped by their values, allowing us to quickly access the keys with the maximum and minimum values.

### Detailed Design
1. **Node Structure**: Each node in the doubly linked list will represent a unique value and store a set of keys with that value.
2. **HashMap Structure**: The HashMap will map each key to its corresponding node in the doubly linked list.

### Example Code in Java

Here's a simplified implementation of the All O`one Data Structure in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class AllOne {
    private class Node {
        int value;
        Set<String> keys;
        Node prev, next;

        Node(int value) {
            this.value = value;
            this.keys = new HashSet<>();
        }
    }

    private Map<String, Node> keyNodeMap;
    private Node head, tail;

    public AllOne() {
        keyNodeMap = new HashMap<>();
        head = new Node(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
        tail = new Node(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        head.next = tail;
        tail.prev = head;
    }

    public void inc(String key) {
        if (keyNodeMap.containsKey(key)) {
            Node node = keyNodeMap.get(key);
            node.keys.remove(key);
            if (node.next.value != node.value + 1) {
                Node newNode = new Node(node.value + 1);
                insertNodeAfter(node, newNode);
            }
            node.next.keys.add(key);
            keyNodeMap.put(key, node.next);
            if (node.keys.isEmpty()) removeNode(node);
        } else {
            if (head.next.value != 1) {
                Node newNode = new Node(1);
                insertNodeAfter(head, newNode);
            }
            head.next.keys.add(key);
            keyNodeMap.put(key, head.next);
        }
    }

    public void dec(String key) {
        if (!keyNodeMap.containsKey(key)) return;
        Node node = keyNodeMap.get(key);
        node.keys.remove(key);
        if (node.value > 1) {
            if (node.prev.value != node.value - 1) {
                Node newNode = new Node(node.value - 1);
                insertNodeAfter(node.prev, newNode);
            }
            node.prev.keys.add(key);
            keyNodeMap.put(key, node.prev);
        } else {
            keyNodeMap.remove(key);
        }
        if (node.keys.isEmpty()) removeNode(node);
    }

    public String getMaxKey() {
        return tail.prev == head ? "" : tail.prev.keys.iterator().next();
    }

    public String getMinKey() {
        return head.next == tail ? "" : head.next.keys.iterator().next();
    }

    private void insertNodeAfter(Node prevNode, Node newNode) {
        newNode.prev = prevNode;
        newNode.next = prevNode.next;
        prevNode.next.prev = newNode;
        prevNode.next = newNode;
    }

    private void removeNode(Node node) {
        node.prev.next = node.next;
        node.next.prev = node.prev;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The `AllOne` class initializes the HashMap and the doubly linked list with dummy head and tail nodes.
2. **Increment Operation**: The `inc` method increases the value of a key. If the key does not exist, it is added with a value of 1. If it exists, it is moved to the next node with an incremented value.
3. **Decrement Operation**: The `dec` method decreases the value of a key. If the key's value becomes 0, it is removed from the data structure.
4. **GetMaxKey and GetMinKey Operations**: These methods return the keys with the maximum and minimum values, respectively, by accessing the tail and head of the doubly linked list.

This design ensures that all operations are performed in constant time, making it highly efficient for scenarios where frequent updates and queries are required[1](https://algo.monster/liteproblems/432)[2](https://iq.opengenus.org/all-oone-data-structure/)[3](https://iq.opengenus.org/design-data-structure-random-get/).
